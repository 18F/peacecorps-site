It can foster a lifelong love of reading in children, give youth the tools they need to succeed in school, and empower adults to continue their education. In impoverished areas, a school library may be the only access children have to reading books - yet according to the South African Department of Education, 78% of the nation's public schools do not have a library. 
<BR><BR>
Your support of the Books for Peace Library Project will make a difference for thousands of children by opening or improving libraries in 30 rural, impoverished South African schools and communities. The organization Books for Africa has generously donated 22,000 books (valued at $220,000) to establish the libraries. Your funding goes towards shipping the books to South Africa and transporting them from port to rural communities, which will cost approximately $16,000.
<BR><BR>
The recipient schools have demonstrated their enthusiasm and commitment to the project by undergoing a rigorous application process. Each has provided a secure space for the library, identified a local volunteer librarian, made a plan for the books' use, and raised $200 within its impoverished community. Together, the communities will contribute $6000 to the project. Each school's nomination has been supported by a Peace Corps volunteer who is committed to helping the libraries become much-used places where children can develop a passion for reading and learning that will last a lifetime.",OH,6000.00,38,10000,0,,Municipal Development,Library,2015-03-25T00:00:00

Books teach lessons, stir imaginations, and offer wisdom. Most Americans grow up reading Dr. Seuss and Grimm's Fairy Tales; however, these valuable sources of enjoyment and learning are scarce in Northern Ghana. In some schools as many as 60 students may share 5 textbooks. Literacy here is low, and without books to teach reading, community members lack even the opportunity to learn.

The money raised by our Peace Corps Partnership funding will secure books to be given to schools, community centers, and reading clubs for the reference and enjoyment of students and community members in 10 different Peace Corps communities. Volunteers in 4 different communities hope to use the new books to start reading clubs. Other Volunteers hope that these will be the first books for new schools and community libraries.

They learn by copying notes from a chalkboard, notes that were written by professors who rarely use much else but the state-provided materials to create lesson plans. Thus “learning” is little more than memorization; students rarely ever fully comprehend the material and critical thinking skills are never taught.
<br><br>
Building a library at the local secondary school will provide students and professors alike with much needed outside resources, which will be used to compliment their studies and lesson plans. Students will be able to develop research skills and study techniques which are critical to their education, and professors will be able to create new and innovative lessons for their students. The library will provide students with a quiet place to study, which will be particularly helpful to female students who are often dragged away from their studies at home to help with domestic chores. A photocopier purchased with funds will not only expedite the installation of electricity at the school, but will reduce the amount of time students spend walking to a nearby town to make copies of documents. The addition of a library will also encourage the school to expand the number of class levels and subjects it offers, which will in turn increase enrollment.

<BR><BR>
An effect of poverty within the fishing communities is the trade of fish for sex, known locally as jaboya. When women do not have the money to buy fish or to get the best catch, they will trade sex for fish. This ingrained practice has been a major factor in spreading HIV throughout the region. Additionally, it reinforces the notion of women as the inferior gender. Rather than being seen as the strong and capable women they are, they are seen as dependent and passive to their male counterparts. This project gives them the means to empower themselves.
<BR><BR>
The premise of this project is to change the work dynamic between the women and the men who make their living from the fishing industry by giving women ownership of the means of production, boats. The women own the boats. As the women work, they repay the cost of building the boat. Then the boat repayment money is pooled to construct more boats; increasing the number of women involved. The women operate as a group; supporting and learning from one another as well as enhancing their own business knowledge and skills.

The project, at its base, is a beautification project, that will encompass two separate but similar murals being painted (3 walls; 50x5, 75x5, 75x5): the first will be a children friendly mural depicting children of our community doing different activities (studying, performing the native dance, playing sports, etc.) with children friendly quotes around the scenes on two of the walls; the second mural will be a simple cubism design using native colors as the focus on the third wall. 

The basis for painting the murals came about from conversations of how we could involve local youth in community improving projects. Three issues to be addressed with this beautification project are: to empower, train, and guide out-of-school youth in a community improving project, to give the youth a positive outlet for their free time and to avoid vices; the second is to improve the municipal’s covered gym because it is the main venue for almost all large events, and much of the gym is drab, thus painting it will improve it aesthetically; the third will be having the youth design and paint the murals in the covered gym, it will raise awareness of their potential to improve the community  in other areas. 

The hope is this project will act as a catalyst for future beautification projects (painting, landscaping, bottle-brick benches, etc.) to be done by the youth in the community.

Bread is culturally significant in Ghana. It is a gift, given upon returning from travel. It is eaten when breaking your fast during the most holy time for Muslims. In the village, it is considered a treat because of its scarcity. 
<BR><BR>
Also scarce in the poor, under-developed Northern Region of Ghana, are well-educated young people. Education is both costly and challenging for many children in rural communities. Therefore, few complete Senior High School (SHS) and less than 1% continue to the tertiary levels of University, Polytechnic or Training Colleges. Due to a scarcity of jobs, it is largely until completion of tertiary level that people can get good jobs; that even can take many years.

With access to education, both the community and its people benefit and can progress. Therefore, the development of my community will be made even much possible and sustainable with access to good education. Lack of jobs and opportunities in small rural villages deny many young students the chance to work for money to pay their school and exam fees. By funding a community-run bread baking business, revenue will be generated to allow these serious, ambitious students of my community to continue their studies.

The idea has come out of work with the “Center for Hope Daycare Center” in southern Mozambique where orphaned or abandoned children come during the day to receive help with school, have a few meals, or even get a bath.  In the small border community, where the HIV/AIDS prevalence rate is one of the highest in the world (18-34%) and child trafficking is a major concern, many orphaned children are moved hastily from one home to another.  They are often placed in homes of relatives or neighbors where they are susceptible to maltreatment and neglect. 
<BR><BR>	
The “Center for Hope Daycare Center” is a good start in dealing with such vulnerable children, but what happens to them when each afternoon they are sent back to unfit homes and are often left without eating until they return to the Center the next day? 
<BR><BR>	
“The House of Hope” is the answer to that.  We are building a house to help children in times of transition to ensure that they are returned to a decent and welcoming home.  It will be located right next to the Daycare Center on land already donated by the community, where they will be looked after by a caretaker provided by the church.  Here they will be taught everything from manners to hygiene, and at the very least will be shown that they are worth being cared for.

Unfortunately, some farmers neglect the impact farming plays in effecting the larger environment. As such, a community in northwest Costa Rica proposed a project that allows farmers to focus on their environmental impact while creating an income generating, cost reducing alternative to their daily activities. The project centers on the creation and use of biodigesters, and serves to educate the members of the community to the benefits of utilizing waste products in the creation of useful products in an environmentally conscious manner. Several of the farms utilize animal waste in its use as manure but fail in taking the same approach in recycling other waste products. Through the process of creation and operation of four biodigesters, not only do the families receiving the biodigesters benefit, but also the community members involved gain the necessary understanding of recycling benefits, as well as the knowledge of how to convert the recycled products into a potential revenue-generating product or cost-saving activity.  The redundancy inherent in having multiple biodigesters will allow the community to still use a biodigester if one should fail while also providing them the opportunity to learn proper maintenance.",GA,1139.81,31,2588.06,0,,Environment,Recycling,2015-03-25T00:00:00

The park regularly takes in animals who have been pets, have been confiscated, or have been discovered abandoned. We have five large cages with animals that cannot be released because they are recovering from injuries, are no longer able to live in the wild, or were kept as pets and would seek food from people's houses. The animals are part of an active education program that brings thousands of students here per year to see the animals and think about the issues that affect them. Including the coati in the education program would allow the guides to talk about the problem of trafficking in wild animals, bringing an important new component to the education program.

Primary school students in this community lack access to quality reading materials and have little exposure to reading in general. A Seed For Reading hopes to create a reading culture in this community by increasing access to reading resources, namely Amharic, Afan Oromo, and English children's books. A library has been established at this primary school, but it does not serve as a library in the traditional sense. The community has contributed a fully-furnished building which currently serves as the school library. The library in its current state, however, is only filled with outdated resource books and old textbooks and does not have any fiction or children's books in Amharic or Afan Oromo. Aside from supplying the school library with new books, this project will establish a reading incentive program and a reading club run by local teachers. This project also aims to increase the capacity of library staff as well as teachers through trainings and workshops. By increasing access to reading materials and expanding the library's capacity, A Seed For Reading will encourage primary school students and teachers to invest more in their personal growth as readers and as learners. 
<BR><BR>
The objectives of A Seed For Reading are as follows: <BR>
1. The school library will be equipped with 1,000 new books by September 2014. <BR>
2. One hundred students will participate in a reading club by November 2014. <BR>
3. Five percent of primary school students will participate in a school-wide reading incentive program by May 2015. <BR>
4. By May 2015, 5% of students will read for pleasure once a week. <BR>
5. By October 2014, all library staff and 5% of teachers will attend a training about library management. <BR>

In response, a local special needs association is partnering with Peace Corps in order to implement a service learning ""Ability Camp"" for 30 at-risk youth with and without special needs. Youth will spend every morning participating in art, sports, and theater activities exploring themes of inclusion and respect. Then, campers will spend every afternoon working together to build their community's first accessible playground. Building the playground will 1) provide youth with special needs an opportunity to present themselves as contributors to their community as opposed to mere recipients of care, 2) allow campers to apply the lessons they learned during their morning activities to real life, and 3) provide a safe, low-maintenance space where everyone, regardless of ability, is welcome to play, make friends, and continue to build a community of inclusion.

Campers will also host a final event to share with the community what they learned and built, and a toolkit will be made available to all Peace Corps volunteers and their counterparts to encourage the creation of similar camps throughout Morocco.

Smithwick","Ahecha Paraguay or ""I see Paraguay"" in a mixture of the country's two official languages, Spanish and Guarani, is a participatory photography project designed to provide Paraguayan youth the opportunity to develop their creativity and gain new life perspectives through the camera's lens. 
<BR><BR>
The project will create four camera kits (five cameras per kit, for a total of twenty cameras) that sixteen volunteers annually will use to organize photography workshops for a minimum of eighty Paraguayan youth in their respective communities. The project includes sixteen photo exchanges between rural communities as a means of expanding inter-community awareness. Ahecha Paraguay will culminate with an annual photo exhibition in the nation´s capital featuring community-selected photographs. 
<BR><BR>
Historically, the nation's arts and creativity have been limited by a legacy of dictatorships. To this day, much of the art and culture are concentrated in the capital city of Asunción; rural comunities are far removed from these creative outlets. Among Paraguayan youth, volunteers have observed the prevalence of inhibited individual expression and low self-esteem. Research shows that ¨students in after-school arts groups 'had nine times as many opportunities to write original text material (not dictated notes) as their classroom counterparts'""[1] and that ¨high arts children also scored higher from teachers' ratings on expression, positive risk-taking, creativity-imagination, and cooperative learning¨.[2] 
<BR><BR>
To address these issues, Ahecha Paraguay project organizers have drawn from participatory photography precedents such as - Kids with Cameras (creators of the Academy-Award winning Born in the Brothels documentary), National Geographic Photo Camps and Nicaphoto (www.nicaphoto.com), in order to develop a project plan that fits the realities of Peace Corps Volunteers and their Paraguayan communities.

Only 17 percent of women participate in secondary school, compared to 27 percent of men. 30 percent of all women are literate versus 52 percent of men. Girls often have predefined roles such as early marriage, bearing and raising children, cooking, cleaning, and farming. Indeed, 36 percent of young women, aged 15 to 19 are currently married, compared to 3 percent of young men. While the Guinean community depends on the work of women, women rarely have leadership roles.

Topics covered include: health, fashion, gardening, cooking, faith, education, success stories and a forum answering taboo questions. Aïcha is to be distributed nationally to schools, communities where Peace Corps volunteers work, and national NGOs. 

The principal goals of Aïcha are: to offer female youth an avenue to express their concerns and desires, to encourage them to succeed, and to explore the role of women in Guinean society.

Currently, with the few Portuguese children's books in my possession, students from the secondary school are reading to students at the primary school. The young student's visible delight at hearing stories and the motivation of the older students doing these read-aloud sessions not only demonstrates the need for more books, but serves as the inspiration for the project. The Institute is willing to donate an already existent library (although stocked only with technical books) with sufficient space and a librarian to safely secure the books and manage their use. With funds from the Peace Corps Partnership, the Institute (upper school) will be able to stock the library with 200 full-color educational children's books in Portuguese purchased through the Maputo-based Books for Kids Africa program from Portugal, Brazil, and Maputo.

The essays will be reviewed by a panel of women and 25 will be chosen to participate.  Each day of the Camp has a different theme: Environmental Stewardship, Health, Opportunities/Goals, Relationships, and Self-Discovery.  Activities and workshops will be conducted by local experts with the goal of promoting women's empowerment.  The communities, government agencies, and a partnering organization are contributing to the success of the Camp.

1) Respect - We focus on building self-confidence as the foundation for personal growth. This in turn leads to the broader long-term goal of boys respecting others, which eventually challenges gender inequalities in society.

3) Professional Development - Expanding the notion of a professional life we present boys with the idea that they have the right to determine their futures and can develop the capabilities to do so.

Due to the cultural norms, these young men will grow up to be the main decision makers and money earners of their households.  However, based on the 2010 Cambodia Demographic and Health survey only 6% of a male population had completed secondary education, with an even lower amount of 4% continuing into higher education.

Most prominent among these are: poor hygienic habits, unjust gender inequality practices, and a lack of goal-setting skills.  Several students between the critical ages of twelve through fourteen are subjected to sexual abuse, pregnancy, and crippling diseases that keep them from attaining their full potential.  Through our work with youth, we see the effect that the inequality of gender roles has on educational outcomes. We also see that the youth we work with feel as if they are victims of a system in which improving their lives in meaningful ways is extremely difficult. Many young women drop out of school as a result of unplanned pregnancies or early marriages, and many more struggle to stay in school and succeed academically. 
<BR><BR>
Despite the government's efforts to enact legislation focused on improving women's rights and expanding educational and economic opportunities, the reality of gender roles in Burkina Faso is such that options are very limited for women who did not finish school. In our communities, we see that women are frequently excluded from decision-making processes and are the victims of domestic violence, sexual harassment, and sexual assault. In order to affect positive change, Burkinabe youth must play more active and substantive roles in their communities. According to U.N. estimates, over 50% of the population is under the age of 20. We feel that the country's future lies in its youth and that it is essential to empower Burkina Faso's young men and women to work together and take a more active role in their communities and in their country's development. 
<BR><BR>
To find a solution to the problems faced by youth in Burkina, Our community members suggested a leadership development camp be organized for 60 Burkinabe youth, and 20 Burkinabe facilitators The camp will be inviting the top students from middle schools in various villages to attend and give the participants the knowledge and the skills to be leaders within their peer groups so they can begin to affect the change they seek in their communities.

1. Promote Healthy Lifestyles: Camp participants will be encouraged and taught how to practice daily hygiene, prevent malaria, improve their nutrition, and apply and promote HIV/AIDS/STI prevention methods. <BR>

Camp GLOW will bring together adolescent women from across the country to encourage them to work towards creating a society that reflects gender equality.
<BR><BR>
In Nicaragua, certain cultural factors, such as machismo, prohibit women from taking advantage of education and employment opportunities in order to fill socially constructed gender roles in the home.  Camp GLOW aspires to break these social frameworks by exposing young women to a wealth of opportunity and providing tools for creating change in their society. At Camp GLOW, young women will attend engaging workshops on topics such as sexual reproductive health, gender equality and gender and global human rights, and strategies for future planning. The camp will promote leadership skills and encourage the girls to return to their communities to implement activities that stimulate gender equality amongst their peers. 
<BR><BR>
Camp GLOW will be a four-day event created in collaboration with Plan Nicaragua.  Plan has developed the agenda for Camp GLOW 2015 based upon their most current campaign: ""Por Ser Nina"".  The campaign focuses on overcoming three barriers that have been identified as impeding young womens' development potential; gender based violence, teenage pregnancy, and unequal access to opportunities.  Addressing these barriers dovetails very nicely with addressing the goals and objectives of Camp Glow 2015. The camp has been designed for 60 participants (ages 12-17).  In order to attend the camp, participants will have to fill out an application form.  This application form will show us each young woman's interest and motivation to participate in, contribute to and take away from the information and experiences offered at camp. Participants will be selected based on their compliance with the application deadline and their ability to articulate past leadership skills and desire to be future leaders in their communities. 
<BR><BR>
Communities throughout the country have pledged support in the form of supplies and snacks, transportation, and most notably in human resources. Donations from the Partnership will fund the remaining costs of the camp: lodging, meals, and remaining transportation costs.

From the economy to public health and everything in between, female empowerment is a key element in the progression and evolution of any given society of human beings. For this reason, Peace Corps as an agency has made Gender and Development a worldwide Peace Corps initiative. Camp GLOW (Girls Leading Our World) is a camp that has been held internationally in Peace Corps countries for many years now. Through our programming, which includes activities, guest speakers, and games, this initiative meets three main components: 1) leadership, including volunteerism, aspirations, goal setting, decision making, and value formation; 2) gender equality, including gender roles and women's empowerment; and 3) self-esteem, including health, positive identity, self-confidence, personal identity, creativity, and self expression. This three-day camp aims to leave its young female participants with an empowered feeling about their identity as females and their potential to achieve in the modern world. By eliciting the help of Paraguayan female leaders and professionals, we hope to not only tell, but show these young girls about the possibilities that they have for success, not only professionally but personally, as well. This will be the fourth year that Camp GLOW is held in Paraguay, and coming off the momentum of last year's success we hope to make this year just as impactful an experience for our youth.

517-304,DOMINICAN REPUBLIC,2009-04-23T10:17:57,"Ceramic Stoves","PA Marchese E.","In a small, rural community in the central region of the Dominican Republic, the men and women rely almost completely on agriculture as their main source of income, growing tobacco, coffee and cacao for export and plantains, yucca and other tubers for personal consumption.  The great majority of men work right in the community, avoiding increasingly high transportation costs to arrive in the nearest town located 30 minutes away.  
<BR><BR>
The cost of travel combined with the cost of propane gas makes cooking on a gas stove a luxury that most community members can't afford.  Instead, women use outdoor wood-burning stoves to cook the great majority of their meals.  In fact, in a community survey, 80% of women in the community reported using an outdoor stove (or fogon) at least half of the time.  The smoke from these stoves, (especially when enclosed in an outdoor kitchen as is most often the case) has been found to be extremely detrimental to the respiratory system.  In a survey completed throughout the community 63% of women reported noticing symptoms related to respiratory infections in their families. These symptoms are seen most often in children under five years of age and women of all ages, due to their likelihood to be in close proximity to the outdoor stoves.  
<BR><BR>
According to the World Health Organization, the Dominican Republic is one of 21 countries most affected by indoor smoke. Indoor smoke has caused 5% of the respiratory diseases in the country. In this community, it is estimated that about 75% of the cases are due to respiratory infections. Mothers have reported symptoms such as congestion, coughs and fevers in family members. In the Dominican Republic, only 60.8% of respiratory infections have been reduced. This project hopes to 1) educate about proper nutrition and food management to lower child malnutrition and 2) build cost-effective, safer, healthier stoves to reduce respiratory and burn cases. This will be done on a ""train the trainers"" model in the hope of empowering people for an improved and healthier future.

The number of active martial arts clubs and federations throughout the country attests the popularity of martial arts with Jordanian youth.  The benefits for youth who study martial arts are numerous, including: improvements in focus, self-discipline, balance, physical abilities, self-confidence, self-respect, and respect for others. However, in rural villages throughout Jordan, many youth have limited access to martial arts training. We propose that not only can these benefits be taught to our Jordanian youth, but can also be inclusive of youth with special needs.  
<BR><BR>
Special education in Jordan is struggling to develop legitimacy in mainstream society. There are still misconceptions about, and stigmas attached to, youth with special needs. Increasing awareness can often be a difficult task due to a lack of opportunities for inclusion. Seeing that Jordanian youth show a great deal of interest in the practice of martial arts, encouraging the participation of youth with special needs in the same practice will not only benefit them mentally and physically, but also provide an avenue for special needs awareness, education, and integration. 
<BR><BR>
Confident of being able to replicate the same results elsewhere in Jordan, Peace Corps volunteers are partnering with martial artist practitioners in developing a sustainable martial arts summer day camp program with a focus on special needs youth awareness.  The Character Development Martial Arts (CDMA) project will incorporate many aspects of the Higher Council for Youth's National Strategy. We aim to collaborate with the Jordan Karate Federation, Higher Council for Youth, Ministry of Social Development, Jordan Special Olympics Committee and the Peace Corps.

The coop will be moved in cycles through the garden beds, while the chickens weed and till the soil, as well as fertilizing it through natural processes (such as scratching and foraging).  After its period under the coop, each individual garden bed will have been weeded and fertilized.  The manure and straw will provide a raised bed for planting, as well as a ""deep mulch"" layer, protecting the soil below from heat and wind.  The bed will then be seeded, and when harvested, the coop will be returned to that bed, providing the chickens with forage.  Over time, even with intensive gardening, the soil will be improved, allowing better nutrition and better yields to come from the garden.  The garden will additionally serve as a demonstration plot and training field, providing the members of the project with a convenient and effective way to extend the technologies to other garden owners in the village.

The problems related to this are many: poor air ventilation means women and their families spend countless hours breathing indoor smoke; children burn themselves in the fire; women spend hours a day crouching, a position that can be especially harmful if they are pregnant; the fires are an inefficient use of firewood, a quickly vanishing natural resource.
<BR>
Clean stoves close kitchen fires, elevate them off the floor away from children, and vent smoke outside to prevent smoke-related health problems.  Because the stoves retain heat, they are a more efficient use of firewood and can cut wood consumption by half.  Women can prepare multiple dishes at the same time, thereby reducing the time spent cooking per day.  Because the stoves also include an oven, women can bake for their families instead of frying their food, an important nutrition concern in Paraguay.
<BR>
In addition to building clean stoves, this project also includes a reforestation component to preserve the source of firewood for future generations.  To help these families better benefit from the stove and reforestation effort, a series of classes will be given on such topics as: stove maintenance, firewood preservation, nutrition, smoke-related health concerns, and more.

O’Connor defined the program, developed the site plan, created the budget, drawn the plans, demolished the existing building, commenced “Stage II” construction and developed the programming for its use.  We have every expectation that the goal of starting rehearsals for the annual Christmas play will begin on the stage in early December.  

The ambition of the construction project for the new theatre aligns with the vision of the Stairway Foundation.  “Our vision is to see all children realize their abilities, hopes and dreams in a society, which will protect and respect their rights as human beings and will hold equality, justice, spirituality, health, education, family, community and the environment as the guiding values and principles for their holistic development”  

The goal of the project is to provide the highest level of design and construction to support this vision.  In every aspect of the project, we are trying to incorporate the best practices and be mindful of incorporating effective passive techniques in providing human comfort while respecting the environment, recycling and energy conservation.   In the demolition of the existing building, every part of the building not infested with termites or wood worm was saved for future reuse.  The elements not infested that Stairway could not reuse, such as the grass roof “tiles” (patches about 1’ x 3’) were placed just outside the entrance of Stairway, and our neighbors bundled them and took them away to use on their homes.  

Stairway Foundation has been a beacon of hope in the community for over 20 years.  They are positioned to influence the surrounding  community with a commitment to responsible planning and ecological awareness.  The PCPP-sponsored project offers the chance to reduce dependence on outside sources of energy.  

 A Philippine-owned company was engaged as an informal energy consultant.  Two solar devices have been specified for inclusion in the project. The two devices, a ventilating fan and a “solartube” will have great impact beyond the energy savings.  Stage II will  be highly visible within the community, because it is a theatre, a place for public assembly.   .  

As is frequently the case, the start-up cost on socially responsible construction is high, and this instance is no exception.  The cost for these two devices is far out of balance with the budget structure.    However, unlike many situations where the technology cannot be properly installed or maintained in remote environments, these two devices require no special maintenance.  The installation will be supervised by the Architect, and is the centerpiece of a teaching module about “Global Warming” for the Stairway School. 

Everyone involved in the creation of “Stage II” has contributed beyond the measure of their financial return.  We would not have been able to accomplish the project were it otherwise.

Some issues regularly raised by members include idleness, the frequently stressful responsibility of their caregivers to care for them, and the financial toll caring for them has on families. Furthermore, MDPC's participation in a focus group discussion on HIV/AIDS and disability revealed HIV/AIDS to be a significant risk for people with disabilities, due to their vulnerability to abuse and dependence. 
A gardening center would address these issues by providing members with an outlet to be productive and contribute to the community, their caregivers a respite from caring for them, and their families' additional sustenance to ameliorate financial hardship. Furthermore, the vegetables grown in the garden can help improve the immune systems of people with disabilities with HIV/AIDS and people in the community at large.  This grant would support the initial construction of fencing around the garden, shading, and tools for gardening.

<BR><BR>
Although practically all residents of the village practice agriculture on some level and the majority of people directly earn a living from farming, local farmers currently do not have a secure place to store their harvests. Due to lack of storage space, they are often forced to sell directly after harvest, when the grain markets are still low, and they do not receive adequate compensation for their products.  Farmers who attempt to store their harvests are obliged to stack their sacks in thatched-roof huts where space is inadequate.  They often suffer considerable losses due to fire, theft, and pests.  The granary project would allow farmers to maintain a livable income and support their families, as they could retain all of their harvests and wait to sell their products until the market prices are favorable. 
<BR><BR>
Funds generated by the project (users of the granary would pay about 20 cents a month per sack) will be used to maintain the building.  Any excess profits will be used to pay the salary of one or more teachers at the local high school to help counteract a serious teacher shortage, improving the quality and quantity of education for local schoolchildren.

However, because most community members communicate almost exclusively in a local African language, learning becomes more difficult as many children enter the education system with almost no Portuguese comprehension.  Furthermore, with a distinct lack of resources, a severe deficit in the number of capable teachers, and class sizes of nearly 100 children, students are at an unimaginable disadvantage in developing even the most basic literacy skills - let alone comprehension and critical thinking skills.

A pilot program run by Books for Kids Africa provided a small selection of 50 Portuguese children's books to Peace Corps Volunteers. Through using these books, we have watched community children progress from learning the alphabet to reading their first book by themselves.  It has been both a rewarding and challenging experience, one that we now hope to extend to the rest of the community through the creation of a community library.

In this vlllage, very few students have access to resources such as school texbooks or sources of literature. The primary and secondary school rate of failure is very high, and believing they have no other option than to begin a long life of farming, these youth are more likely to marry and begin to have children at an early age, contributing further to Tanzania's increasing population. Furthermore, these large family sizes mean that each individual child is less likely to recieve an education.  Part of this problem is poverty  that made some parents not being able to buy education references such as books and other resources.  This situation leads few students to get a chance to join secondary school and sometimes those by chance selected to join secondary education to lack some important information that would help them to have better performance in higher levels.  Given this situation the community has proposed a library on the Primary School grounds. The library will be accessible to the village's 800 primary and secondary school students as well as 1000+ other community members, including out of school youth, farmers, elders, and family members.  The intention is to stock this library with primary and secondary school  textbooks, vocational Swahili books on agriculture and trade skills, Swahili literature, and Swahili life skills books (eg. Decision making, leadership, avoiding drugs and alcohol, family planning, women's rights), to improve the accessibility of educational resources and information among members of the community.

This combined with the fact that a young boy beginning first grade drowned during the rainy season. All of the children from the area in which the preschool will be built are forced to cross that same river if they want to attend school. These facts have struck at the hearts and minds of the parents within the community, they want to take action. The community has already put for ample effort to the cause, including forming a preschool committee, preparing, molding, and burning over 5,000 bricks. They have also picked and cleared the location of the school and collected river sand. They are currently working every Monday to ensure they have collected all of the proper materials available locally to build. 
<BR> <BR>
This village is located in a remote area, with the center point of the village consisting of a football grounds, and a one room mud-hut which they use as a health post. The hope of the community is to further educate their children and to open the opportunity for future growth of the overall area. This village is comprised of about fifty households of which some are polygamist families with many children. The school would provide education for the children of this village as well as the five immediate surrounding villages. 
<BR> <BR>
The preschool committee has released applications for local residents to apply for the teaching positions. The preschool will be a facility that will also provide and bring local jobs to the area for two people who meet the qualifications. The preschool will provide an early education for a maximum of six classes of thirty students, or a total of up to 180 pupils. The classes will include, but are not limited to basic literacy, social studies, science, and math. Through games, songs, and interactive activities the preschool will creative a warm and welcoming learning environment.",MN,17295.08,78,5000,0,,Municipal Development,School/Class Construction,2015-03-25T00:00:00

The climate of this region is characterized by a short rainy season and an extended dry season. Presently, the wells in our community are too shallow to reach a sustainable source of groundwater. Therefore, during dry season, the wells run dry. For approximately 6 months out of the year, our community searches for water at the river. Women are responsible for this burden, walking several miles to search for river water. The river is not a safe source of drinking water. Therefore, we face an increasingly difficult condition each year as families in our village are denied the basic human necessity of safe drinking water. Having identified a lack of water as a priority issue, the community mobilized itself to develop a plan of action to solve this problem. Community members formed a committee and identified resources that could aid in a water project. The community 	decided that they have the internal resources and capacity to dig a well. Thus, the community will contribute a substantial amount of manual labor, food and lodging for workers, and transportation of materials. The aim of this project is to utilize internal and external resources to construct a well that will reach a sustainable source of groundwater. This project will provide our community with its first clean, sustainable source of drinking water, considerably lowering the cases of water-borne diseases. The women in the community will walk a shorter distance to fetch water, giving them more time to engage in other activities. Furthermore, the women will spend less time near the river or streams which could contain malaria infected mosquitos. A new well will afford young girls the time to focus on their studies.

This improved well would serve to not only provide a needed source of water which would ultimately not dry up during the hot season, but would also serve as the first step towards the village’s vision of a large-scale community garden uniting both these isolated neighborhoods.  As both neighborhoods currently have traditional wells which are not always reliable, and their own separate women’s groups, opportunities to work together to improve their gardening practices and increase income-generating activities are rare.

In addition to the initial identification and planning of the project, the villagers will be aiding the hired mason by collecting sand and water for cement mixing and performing gravel removal and transport.

This population consists mostly of women, children, middle-aged men, and seniors, as most college-age youth leave the community to look for opportunities in nearby cities.  At this time, youth and adults living within and around the area have no dependable form of capacitating themselves in the use of computers.  There are no local, privately-run computer centers and no computers can be found within the area’s primary and secondary schools.  For individuals that aspire to attend university or work professionally, it is a challenge to qualify or excel without some form of basic computer literacy.

A non-profit community organization, Consejo Comunitario de Salud y Medio Ambiente, has been working within rural communities in the area and has committed itself to the creation of a community computer center.  Although the organization typically focuses on health and environmental projects, they recognize the extreme need for computer literacy for the youth and adults of local communities.  The objective of this project is to create a technology center where interested youth and adults can take basic courses in Windows programs and typing as well as advanced courses in computer maintenance and repair.  The anticipated result is a significant population of computer literate individuals who are better prepared to find higher-paying employment opportunities, and/or attend college or technical school.

The lack of computer knowledge discourages many from applying to institutions of higher education or looking for scholarship opportunities. Teachers and students at the local Secondary School are also at a disadvantage. Many teachers lack the ability to organize lesson plans, keep reliable grade books or type basic computer documents. Everything is done by hand and original copies are hard to find. Exams are handwritten on the chalkboard by teachers for students to copy and complete in just 45 minutes, resulting in poor scores. With more than 3,000 students a year and 60 dedicated teachers, this Secondary School deserves to offer the invaluable experience of using a computer to its community.

The school is already equipped with a basic computer lab containing around thirty computers donated in 2005. Unfortunately, these computers have become a perfect example of unrealized charity; the valuable resources sitting idly for the past five years due to lack of training, insufficient resources, and poor quality of computers. 
<BR><BR>
The ultimate vision is for the entire community to become more locally competitive and globally connected as they utilize today’s technology in improving their professional and personal lives.
<BR><BR>
To jumpstart this long-term vision, there are two major objectives for our proposed project. The first objective is to increase the knowledge and skills of the students on ICT. This will be accomplished by improving the current technology courses to include effective computer education modules for the students. The second overall objective of the project is to increase the knowledge and skills of the community members, including teachers, government employees, unemployed professionals, and out-of-school youth, on ICT. Holding computer literacy trainings will provide the means from which to achieve this second objective.

Several community contributors will be financing major costs of the project; the high school is contributing the majority of the ongoing project funds including labor, maintenance, Internet connection, electricity, and basic classroom supplies. As the largest secondary community contributor, the local government unit is providing support with their significant donation from the municipal education fund. The students have also been raising money, by collecting and selling recyclables, to contribute to the computer lab improvement fund.

•	According to UNICEF and WHO, regions with the lowest coverage of “improved sanitation” are Sub-Saharan Africa (31%), Southern Asia (33%), and Eastern Asia (65%).
•	7 out of 10 people without access to improved sanitation conditions are rural inhabitants.

Disease & Death:
•	More than 1 million children under 5 years old perish from diarrhea each year, mostly in developing countries such as Togo. This amount to more than 11% of the 7.6 million deaths of children under the age of five (~2,200 child deaths each day as a result of diarrheal related diseases).
•	Unsafe drinking water, inadequate availability of water for hygiene, and lack of access to proper sanitation together contribute to more than 88% of diarrheal related deaths.
•	Majority of hospital consultation at my post are related to unsanitary behavior.

Key activities include training in entrepreneurship, vocations, and life skills, along with hands-on apprenticeships in two sheltered workshops.  A foundation is funding this 1-year pilot.  
<BR><BR>
Participants who demonstrate creative talents will receive further training in these workshops to hone their practical skills.  Instruction in craft-making processes like candle-making, pottery, ceramics, woodwork, etc. will be provided.  Specialized craft-making tools/equipment are needed to ensure efficient craft production in order to compete in the marketplace.  Their exact identification will depend on the demonstrated talents of the pilot group.

Only one workshop was originally budgeted from the external foundation, but logistics of transporting people with disabilities throughout northern Moldova to one site became too problematic.  Now, a second workshop is needed elsewhere, which will afford greater and easier access to a broader audience but entails additional equipment.  Fortunately, community support from both locations was obtained in the form of physical sites for the workshops.

Therefore, we seek additional funds to address this consequence. Moreover, the workshops will operate as an income-generating small business, administered by those beneficiaries trained in entrepreneurship.

There is currently little artistic curriculum in Cambodian schools, and children and adults have difficulty finding outlets for their creative energy and talent. In recent years, however, arts NGOs throughout the country have ventured to reintroduce Cambodians to artistic endeavors and to remind them of their rich cultural past. It is in this spirit that the Create Cambodia Arts Festival was formed. We aim to inspire participants with an interest in the arts to pursue their artistic passions while equipping Cambodian educators with the tools necessary to foster this creative spirit.
<BR><BR>
Programming for Create Cambodia starts in Peace Corps Volunteers' villages where they and their Khmer counterparts form arts clubs with students in their communities. These students are then treated to a 3-day arts festival where they present the creative pieces they rehearse, see professional artists perform and engage in classes, activities and games led by NGOs, counterparts and PCVs.
<BR><BR>
The inspiration for this project came directly from students and educators lamenting the lack of creative opportunities in their villages. Students, NGOs and teachers alike are all excited about this project and will collaborate with PCVs to create presentations and activities for the festival.  Create Cambodia strives to equip students with basic knowledge of and access to the arts and to provide Khmer educators with instructional experience to continue inspiring Cambodian students in the future.

The sole middle school of Tiro has not been updated since its construction in the mid-1960s. Due to the harshness of the elements during the rainy season, roughly five months in duration, and the abuse of years of animal and human foot traffic, the floors of all six classrooms have disintegrated into gravel, dust, and in some places craters. The combination of uneven flooring and hurried craftsmanship has led to the deterioration of desks over the years; with no funds available for replacement, students are forced to sit three or four to a two-person desk, thus hampering the ability to effectively take notes, or be motivated to, and causing arguments over seating, which disrupt classes. A further hindrance to the learning environment is that of cracked, chipped, and poorly painted blackboards. Many sections of the solitary blackboard found in each classroom are unusable and thus less information can be presented per class period.

However, many community members are not aware of this and continue burning plastic bags in the privacy of their homes, making it more difficult for this policy to be enforced.

Established in 1981, the home continues to provide young people with formal education, as well as a variety of programs and services that prepare the residents for independent living.  Their Eco-Learning Farm has been one such program.
<BR><BR>
The vision of the Eco-Learning Farm is to grow an eco-friendly, productive, and sustainable learning farm that offers a safe and unique environment for youth development programs plus a supply of fresh, organic produce for use in meals at the center.  Since the half-acre was prepared for cultivation in 2009, the farm has grown along with the learning opportunities.  The staff and Peace Corps volunteer (PCV) designed a curriculum for farm-based learning activities to harness the excitement and energy the residents have for working outdoors.  Activities during the 2010 and 2011 growing seasons focused on three areas of youth development; academics, leadership, and life skills building.  Activities were part of support projects, such as installing a deep-water well, establishing a plant nursery, hosting a Farm to Fork cooking demonstration.  Support projects were facilitated by the staff, PCV, and youth leaders, and have served to bring the children's home closer to its Eco-Learning Farm vision.   
<BR><BR>
Increasing youth-friendly signage on the farm is the next support project. Partnership funds of $200 will purchase materials to make youth-friendly signs.

Part of the experience in the community revolves around a boardwalk that was built in the jungle by the community eight years ago.
<BR><BR>
The community boardwalk is approximately 400 meters long running from the mouth of the main river to the entrance of the community. This boardwalk serves two purposes: the first, and most important, is that the boardwalk allows community members to walk out of the community when the tide is low to the main river to be able to leave in case of emergency. The second reason involves allowing safe passage for the groups of tourists to and from the community. Being able to walk to a point on the river that is not affected by the tide would allow the visitors to spend more time in the community enjoying the culture and surrounding wilderness of the Embera. The boardwalk has cement posts that were installed by the community and have barely been affected by the climate of Panama. However, the wood boards that are placed over the concrete frame are rotting because they were not sealed when the community originally built the boardwalk. The community wants to replace all of the boards on the boardwalk, seal them with a waterproof sealant to assure that the wood does not rot, and work to improve traffic to the community with the improved boardwalk. Also, because the community members will have to cut down hardwood trees from the surrounding jungle, the community has agreed to start a hardwood tree nursery in the community to assure in fifteen years there will be more hardwood trees available to repair the boardwalk as necessary. For every one tree that is cut down, the community has agreed to plant 20.

This project aims at creating a computer area in the ICT lab that will be available for the teachers during the day and students who are conducting research during free periods. These computers will allow teachers to implement their knowledge and skills in incorporating technology in the classroom, finding resources available through the internet, completing grades electronically, and completing other required duties. The computer skills gained will empower the youth for global competitiveness and help to unlock their potential.

In this region, there is extensive deforestation due to the harvesting of firewood. In addition, firewood is extremely expensive. Through surveys conducted, it has been found that there are negative health implications from using traditional wood-burning stoves and ovens. The recipients of the energy efficient stoves and ovens will benefit from this technology due to their current reliance on firewood to cook and bake. The project began by selecting the recipients from a larger pool that had an interest in utilizing and promoting sustainable cooking and baking practices. 20 families will receive energy efficient cook stoves and 3 families and the technical school have been designated as the recipients of the energy efficient ovens. The recipients of the energy efficient ovens are all from different neighborhoods in which they occasionally sell cakes, sweet bread and plain white bread to make a small income. Currently, these neighborhoods lack a consistent provider of baked goods, so the new ovens will give these women the opportunity to bake more regularly while benefiting the community and making a profit. The use of the oven at the technical school to conduct community baking classes will help promote this new energy efficient technology and increase awareness for the need to conserve firewood, a valuable natural resource. 
<BR><BR>
The second phase was the planning stage, in which the recipients reviewed and discussed the timeline, budget and necessary contributions from the community. The next phase will be constructing the 20 energy efficient cook stoves and 4 energy efficient ovens. After construction, there will be a follow-up interview with each recipient, a survey to identify the sustainable outcome of the project and finally, the planting of a community tree nursery of 120 trees as a reforestation effort. Project recipients will participate in three follow-up workshops upon oven completion: a showcase of the oven that take place at the technical school in which recipients will present to other community members the oven's environmental benefits in an effort to improve awareness of the effects of deforestation, a baking class in which oven recipients and students at the technical school will learn new recipes to sell in their small businesses and finally, a small business workshop in which they will learn how to effectively run their baking businesses by keeping track of their incomes and expenses.",PA,908.06,54,783.2,0,,Health and HIV/AIDS,Stoves,2015-03-25T00:00:00

First-hand learning experience is also important in constructing knowledge. The college students from the College of Teacher Education (CTE) hope to have a personal learning experience to bridge the history of Americans and Filipinos through visiting landmarks in the Philippines. 

Educational tours are benefical to students' learning. Students will encounter elders from the regions and have personal conversations with them, understanding that even in the Philippines, different regions have different cultures and values. In this way, students will develop greater empathy for others and be able to see different aspects of their own culture. Furthermore,  students will be able to draw connections on the different issues they've been learning in class: conflict between the Filipinos and Americans and conflict of interests in their own country. Coming back to their homes, students will gain a new perspective of their own home town, once they learn to think about social issues affecting other provinces in a holistic way. 

The three goals we have in this project are to provide an opportunity for the students to learn through exploring and discovering significant places, to widen the students' understanding of the Filipino and American cultures, and to enhance English proficiency through reading, speaking, writing, and performing in English.

Whether it is for food, or security, health, education or commerce, electricity is an understood necessity.  In America today it is taken for granted.  However, much of the world must function without it.  With the relatively small sum of $2,672, five villages in rural West Africa, holding a combined population of over 3600 people, will receive extensions of existing electrical lines thus providing electricity.  This grant will finance the installation of this extension, and thus village schools, health centers, churches, mosques, small businesses, water pumps, mills and individual homes will be afforded the opportunity to “plug in” and dramatically enhance productivity, safety, sanitation, communication, and overall quality of life.  This grant will also directly install electricity into the local secondary school, providing innumerable benefits to local education.  
 The benefits of electricity in village life are too numerous to be recounted.  Health centers will have hot water, students will receive photocopies of important documents, nighttime crime will decrease, the community water pump will be cheaper and stop breaking down, food prices will decrease, and people will have access to local and international news.  Refrigerators, light bulbs and fans can be used.  The list of benefits goes on and on.  Many locals claim that the villages are on the decline.  It is said that the people are becoming poorer.  Those with means are leaving for towns and cities and not returning.  This grant will effectively reverse the downward spiral of the villages, shifting the situation from the current state of decline into one of rapid and sustainable development.

English reading comprehension rates for 76% of first-year high school students (ages 11-13) are equivalent to a second grade level in the United States, based on results from Philippine Independent Reading Inventory and SRA/McGraw-Hill Reading Laboratory assessments conducted during the 2011-12 school year.  To deal with this issue, a remedial reading program was started and a library was created in August 2011 to serve as a repository of literacy/remedial reading materials for the school.  However, this space lacks adequate shelving, has out-of-date resources, is drab and stuffy due to poor ventilation, and overall is not student-friendly.  The school librarian alongside the English Department, comprised of eight teachers, have developed plans for improving the library space, with the help of the Peace Corps Partnership Program.

This project will create a multifunctional learning room within the library. It will be the classroom for the remedial reading program for the 2012-13 school year, as well as serve as an audiovisual/research lab for faculty and students.  Thanks to a local donation, fifteen computers have been made available for use in this space. Table, chairs, textbook sets, teaching materials, and a projector purchased with grant funds will establish and enhance an appropriate workspace. A centralized air conditioning will create a climate-controlled environment, increasing the lifespan of the new technologies in an otherwise hot, humid space. After receiving these materials, the faculty and staff will receive an enhancement training, focused on exploring strategies for effectively using the audiovisual equipment to increase literacy.

The training will cover basic diabetes knowledge, the importance of diet and exercise, as well as how to safely test their blood sugar and properly inject insulin. 
The majority of funds raised for this project will be used to purchase 50 testing meters for the diabetics within the community. A testing meter is a small and simple battery operated device, which allows a person to monitor their glucose level by pricking their finger and applying a droplet of blood on a testing strip. This process takes about 15 seconds. 
Current healthcare policy for Thailand does not cover the costs of testing meters; therefore, Thai diabetics never know what their blood sugar is on a day-to-day basis. Presently, diabetic individuals in the district only check their blood sugar one time per month, during doctor visits, rather than the American Diabetes Association recommendation of 150-180 times per month. The rarity of how often they test their glucose level can be detrimental to their overall health.
As of now, local knowledge on managing diabetes is sparse and often the disease is treated as if it's the common cold, as if with time it will pass.

The majority of the 250 residents in Cerrito cook on the ground over an open fire and this cooking practice is both unhealthy and unsafe.  It is especially harmful for the women and small children that spend significant amounts of time each day preparing meals in the small, enclosed kitchens.  Cooking over an open fire not only causes respiratory illnesses due to the thick smoke inhaled each day, but also produces chronic back pain due to the repetitive bending up and down.  Furthermore, open fires are dangerous for small children because they can easily fall into them.  Women are also limited in their ability to cook nutritious food due to the lack of an oven and therefore the staple diet of many residents in Cerrito consists of foods that are fried instead of baked.  <BR><BR>  A fogon can eliminate many of these problems because it is an elevated cooking surface equipped with a chimney that prevents the inhalation of large amounts of harmful smoke and repetitive bending motions.  Although the fogon requires the use of firewood to function, one can simultaneously use the burners as well as the oven.  This not only conserves energy, but also allows for the preparation of healthier foods. <BR><BR>  In the community of Cerrito, the women’s group has been organizing activities throughout the past year, such as selling soap and bread, in order to raise funds to build the fogones.

Currently, over 95% of the families that live in Colonia Yerovia cook on a slow-burning fire on the kitchen floor.

Currently, over 90% of the families that live in Yaguarete Cora cook over a slow-burning fire on the kitchen floor. This cooking method is unsafe and unhealthy; deforestation is becoming more widespread, children may accidentally burn themselves and women must tolerate daily plumes of thick smoke that can cause respiratory illness. In addition, deforestation is increasing as inefficient stoves require large amounts of firewood to function.  
<BR><BR>
A fogon, or wood-burning stove, offers clear advantages. The fogon’s raised cooking surface places the fire out of children's reach, while its chimney clears the kitchen of smoke.  Moreover, the cooking surface accommodates four cooking pots, while an oven allows the women to bake food as well. This allows women to cook more efficiently, while using less firewood.  
<BR><BR>
This project includes the construction of 35 family fogon stoves and planting of 10 trees per family. The community will supply labor and a portion of the cost to buy materials.  Partnership funds are needed to purchase stove materials and transport them to Yaguarete Cora.

Local organizations have recognized this problem and focus on improving the nutrition of children through feeding programs and education for mothers.  Their efforts have improved the situation, but changing in-home habits is difficult.  <BR><BR> A need the community has previously identified, but not succeeded in addressing is an alternative to cooking over open fire, which presents a serious respiratory risk from indoor air pollution.  Pastoral de Niños, a Catholic organization that is focused on improving the health of children, has proposed a fogón (brick stove) building project to the municipality, which failed to receive support.  With the arrival of a new soy machine, and soy milk and meat production managed by a work team of the San Rafael Neighborhood Commission, a renewed interest in building fogones has surfaced.  Residents now have an inexpensive and healthy raw material to cook with, but limited availability.  Therefore, in congruence with local leaders, a commission has been formed to build fogones.  The Pro-Fogón Commission decided that because of the scale of the project, with approximately a third of the 130 households expressing interest, a family contribution accompanied by needed aid is the best model.  Because local support is unlikely, with municipal apathy toward the project, the community is seeking the necessary funds though the Peace Corps Partnership Program.",NY,663.36,32,1438.19,-50,,Health and HIV/AIDS,Stoves,2015-03-25T00:00:00

However, 730 students (one third) and their teachers do not have classrooms at its public middle/high school. Consequently, classes are conducted outdoors, sometimes exceed 60 students, and are held from the early morning into the night. Students have large gaps in their schedules when they wander off and get into trouble.

To reduce these problems, a Volunteer, the local community, the school administration, and a local Catholic church have joined together to construct a four-classroom building. The project involves three stages: planning/fundraising, building, and sustaining the improved educational environment.

The total project costs $39,474. Of that, 32% ($12,609) will come from the community though donations and contributions of labor and materials. The church, which has 26 years of experience with similar projects in the region, will give 43% ($16,865). The last 25% ($10,000) needs to come from donors like you.
<BR><BR>
Building will take 2.5 months during the summer of 2014. A trusted local contractor will lead the work while students and community members help.

The best part of this is that the area lacks the capital for competitors, so the demand will always ensure that these secondary goals have funding.  Mothers know the importance of the primary education that their children currently do not have access to, and all students dream of the chance to attend university. This project will address both needs; the potential impact is truly the opprotunity for a better life.

In 2007, 400 students from this Chiefdom (region) passed the National Primary School Examination and were qualified to go on to Junior Secondary School. Unfortunately, there was only one junior secondary school in the Chiefdom limiting the number that would be able to continue their education locally to just half that. The remaining students would either be forced to attend school elsewhere or, more likely, would just drop out.

This prompted community members to open another secondary school in order to meet the community's growing need for educational facilities. The school was met with overwhelming community support. Additionally, the school grew rapidly: from 20 students when it opened in 2008 to over 300 students by the 2011/2012 school year.  While this rapid growth was a sign of high community support and need, it also meant that the number of students had quickly become too large for the community building they occupied and the students soon outnumbered the desks.

Fortunately, the community and a Non-Governmental Organization have helped to construct two new school buildings, both of which are expected to be ready for use by September of 2012.

With an average fertility rate of 3.3 children per woman and an average family income of $219 per month, women often are forced to endure the repercussions of gender inequalities in a broken economy (UNICEF 2007, Philippine National Statistics Office 2007). While most girls assume they will finish high school, only 67% of girls nationwide are enrolled (UNESCO Statistics on Philippine Education).  In addition, girls who come from impoverished families are at higher risk for early pregnancy, child marriage, child sexual abuse, and exploitation in the sex industry. Furthermore, these girls are not encouraged to have hopes and dreams for their futures, nor are they given the tools to become self-determined, strong women.
The GEAR (Girls Empowerment Activity Retreat) Camp hopes to bring together thirty girls, ages 14-17, from two area organizations for a 3-day retreat focusing on empowerment and self-development. Topics will include: Self-esteem and self-confidence building, interpersonal skills, gender issues, and communication skills. The camp will be a safe place for girls to meet girls their own age and talk about topics that are important to them. In addition, it will also be a time for them to relax and be relieved of the pressures of their everyday lives. 
With assistance from the two PCVs, the camp will be facilitated by six young women and two local social workers who will be trained as counselors prior to the camp. Through educating and empowering young female leaders on such issues as self-development, gender issues, self-esteem, and leadership, the GEAR Camp will equip the girls to return to their respective centers and communities with additional knowledge to lead their own empowerment and the empowerment of those around them.

This year we will host two five-day leadership and health camps, where 100 girls, ages 9-19 will have the opportunity to address issues that they face daily in their communities, such as avoiding teen pregnancy, combating HIV/AIDS and empowering other girls to become strong leaders. 
<BR><BR>
Camp would not be nearly as successful without our dedicated counselors and senior counselors. This year, we have a team of 18 senior counselors returning to take part in the training and capacity building aspect of camp. Senior counselors will first undergo a two-day training where they will learn important skills such as facilitation, lesson planning, and public speaking. They will then work to plan the Training of Trainers, where over 60 Swazi women will gain the skills necessary to act as counselors at camp and in their clubs.  These women serve as strong role models for the girls, and act as club organizers and leaders across Swaziland. Thus, GLOW activities serve to not only unite girls nationwide, but also work to standardize the curriculum and build partnership across the country.  
<BR><BR>
Once the essential training has taken place, the senior counselors and counselors will return to their communities in order to select the girls who will attend camp. As stated above, there will be two camps held this year. The first one will be geared towards the older girls (aged 13-19), while the second one will focus more on disseminating information to younger girls (aged 9-12). This idea was encouraged by the senior counselors, who mentioned a specific need to teach and empower younger girls as a means to foster leadership at an earlier age, and encourage the development of positive role models in the communities. The two camps are a significant part of this PCPP, and are treasured experiences for the girls and counselors who get to participate. Having the opportunity to bring young women from across the Kingdom together is invaluable, and nurtures empowerment in a way that many other interventions can't, because these girls get to share their stories; fears and hopes for the future, and begin the process of working to achieve not only their dreams, but those of their sisters from all across Swaziland.

Additionally, for the first time ever, these leaders will serve on the GLOW committees alongside the Peace Corps Volunteers.

Permagardens are environmentally sound and economically viable, and as a result, the benefits of permagardening are many: high-yield potential quickly, easy to manage, and the opportunity for year-round diet and biodiversity.

The goal is to create a garden that will help feed the students.  In order to start a garden it is first necessary to make sure the garden will have what it needs to survive. This means it needs water, protection, and nutrients.  Therefore there are four main objectives:
<BR>
Objective one, to build an enclosure to protect the garden from outside animals.  
<BR>
Objective two, build a reservoir to make watering efficient.  
<BR>
Objective three, create composting pits to make sure there is always a source of nutrients for the garden.  
<BR>
Objective four, to design the garden, plant, grow, harvest, and use the crop.  
<BR><BR>
Throughout the project the volunteer will lead a one hour per week in class gardening session. This session will educate the students on the theory behind essential gardening techniques such as mulching, composting, crop rotation, and other good gardening practices.  The garden can serve as a physical resource for the science teachers.  Biology is a big part of the curriculum and having a garden with a large variety of plants will give students physical examples of plant life.  
<BR><BR>
It takes a lot of work to create and maintain a successful garden.  The school will be providing all labor.  Most of the labor will be a part of the learning process, and will be done by the students at school.  This means that it will be the students who build the fence, reservoir, and composting pits.  They will also be planting the seeds and watering every day.  The school is also providing transportation of materials, water for the plants, and the land where the garden will be built.",CA,616.67,34,1173.33,0,20-MAY-11,Agriulture,Ag-Community Garden,2015-03-25T00:00:00

615-202,KENYA,2012-08-21T11:39:21,"Getting Jiggers with it - Helping to Fight Jiggers in Kenya","IL Storm J.","Tungiasis, commonly referred to as ""jiggers,"" is a neglected tropical disease that is endemic in Latin American, the Caribbean, and Sub-Saharan Africa. Jiggers is caused by the female sand flea (Tunga Penetrans), which penetrates the skin causing severe inflammation and other severe morbidities, including ulcerations, necrosis, auto amputation, difficulty walking, tetanus and even death. In Kenya it was estimated that 2.6 million people were infected with jiggers. Despite its prevalence and negative health impact, jiggers has not become a priority for the development of public health interventions. 
<BR><BR>
My hope with this project is to bring awareness to this disease and be a motivation for others in the health field to start the fight against jiggers. In my area, jiggers not only causes severe health complication but also impacts work and school attendance because of the inability to walk or concentrate. Also there is stigma associated with the disease that isolates those infected even more. This project is taking a systematic approach to the prevention and treatment of jiggers. The project will treat 100 people in a Kenyan village for jiggers. Before, during, and after treatment, the participants will receive education on prevention of the disease. Also the home compounds will be fumigated to rid the homes of the pest. The recommended way of treatment is to soak the affected area three times a day for two weeks in a solution or to extract the fleas using a sterile procedure. However, the extraction method often leads to secondary infections and is not the preferred way to treat severely ill individuals. In addition to treating the individual it is also recommended to treat the environment and the animal reservoirs present. Unlike some neglected tropical diseases, Jiggers is costly to treat. The soaking solution, potassium permanganate, runs about $30 per person and with the addition of other supplies needed it comes out to about $50 per person to get treated. This may not seem like a lot, but here in Kenya that amount of money is more than half of a year's salary! We are asking for the partners to provide funds to cover the most expensive supplies needed for the campaign (soaking solution, home fumigation, and oil). The community is providing the rest for the campaign. The Primary Health Care team has partnered with Ahadi Kenya Trust (Kenya's only national anti-jigger campaign) and the District Medical offices to help make this project a success. In addition, the Primary Health Care team is raising funds for this project throughout the district to begin raising awareness and make this project a success.

The camp focused on building leadership capacity with a different action area each day including: health, business, environment, culture and future. Participants were motivated and bright individuals with social and financial limitations on their ability to pursue educational opportunities, selected from nine middle schools within these regions. The camp was a success in strengthening the determination and necessary skills to continue working toward their desired futures. Major aspects of the success of the camp were the participation of Senegalese counterparts working alongside the Peace Corps volunteers as counselors, and also the Senegalese professionals who came to speak to the campers about the opportunities and challenges for women pursuing education and careers.

We hope to work with some of the same counterparts who were so integral to last year's success, adding to the sustainability of the project.

The design of the camp is a reflection of the needs as a result of the TNA that was held prior to camp. The TNA is based on the Skills for Life manual by the Consuelo Foundation and encompasses the life skills of “interpersonal relationships, critical thinking and decision making, problem solving and conflict resolution, self awareness and stress management, and setting goals.”  The TNA results showed the participants’ interest and need in developing their skills in the areas of interpersonal relationships, critical thinking, decision making and goal setting.  Therefore these skills will be the focus of the camp.

The objective of this camp is that participants will possess the confidence and empowerment in leadership to facilitate the camp’s leadership workshops through the ECHO program, which is a built in leadership development and practice tool for the participants. By organizing a group of youth at the respective center for the girls to ECHO to, they can test their newly-strengthened skills and bring back their knowledge to their peers. This group will meet once a week for five weeks and each participant will have a week to facilitate their 1-2 hour session. This will be co-facilitated by center staff.  The outcome of the ECHO program is the opportunity for the girls to be active in planning and implementing their leadership skills and be seen as leaders in their center.  Follow- up activities related to this Echo will be managed and supervised by center staff.

A good way of educating many people on these subjects at one time is through a Health Fair. In a small, poor farming community that is secluded from the rest of Jamaica, it is difficult for residents to receive good and accurate health information.  Because the community is so small and difficult to reach, many health education organizations are reluctant to travel to the area.  We understand that these organizations have limited resources and need to be cautious in choosing events to attend so as to maximize their resources.

The solution to this problem is to have a Health Fair at a central location and bus in residents from the area to attend.

Located 25 kilometeres outside of Linguere on an unpaved, bush road, the Case du Sante (health hut) is the only health infrastructure resource available to the community within the village itself. The Case du Sante primarily serves as the facility where almost all babies born in the village are delivered. Newborns are delivered in the health hut by the Matrone, who is the only formally trained health worker in the village and oversees, along with the Committee du Sante, Case du Sante affairs and maintenance. Our Case du Sante secondarily functions as the site where monthly consultations and vaccinations are held with a visiting ICP (doctor) who is based out of our closest Poste du Sante 10 kilometers away, and where monthly growth monitoring sessions and occasional health causeries are held by the Matrone and PCV.  With approximately 400 children under the age of 5 and approximately 300 women of reproductive age (WORA) directly using and benefiting from the services of our Case du Sante, maximizing the facility's functionality by ensuring the quality and presence of adequate materials and equipment, by improving the aesthetic value of the space, and by creating a moringa-intensive garden at the site would serve to boost our Case du Sante's overall utility and accessibility within the community. All requests for new materials/equipment and improvements to the structure itself (including an attached morninga-intensive garden and a new outside shade structure) were conceived by the Community Health Committee, and the community is committed to contributing at least 25% of the total project costs in the form of donated labor, materials, and monetary support.

Additionally, the improvements to the Case du Sante interior will make current practices of record keeping and storing medicines much more efficient and satisfactory according to Senegal Health Ministry standards. Building an outdoor garden will also enable the Case du Sante to grow its own supply of moringa, a low-maintenance plant with high nutritient value that can be transformed into powder as an easy-to-use supplement to effectively combat malnutrition and encourage healthy habits.

The water pump will be built at the high school of approximately 800 students and 40 faculty members. This school has been operating with no clean water source on site since its creation in 2005. The closest water source is over a kilometer away across a major highway entering the nearby regional capital city. 
<BR><BR>
This creates a hazard to kids crossing the road searching for water. Beyond the risk of accident, this creates a constant distraction from learning, as kids often have to be excused to fetch water to drink. If the students avoid leaving class to fetch water, the result is dehydration. This is especially likely during the sub-sahelian dry season, which extends over two-thirds of the school year. Studies show decreased scholastic performance among school children due to the body's limited ability to perform cognitive functions under varying levels of dehydration (Bar-David et al, 2005). Contributing to the problem of dehydration among students is the long (5-7 kilometer) commute many of them make on foot from neighboring villages. Given a clean source of drinking water, we expect students to be more focused and to perform at a higher level.
<BR><BR>
There are serious hygienic repercussions of the lack of clean water at the school. There are latrines on site for students to use; however, without a source of water the students are unable to wash their hands. School absences then increase due to illnesses that are easily prevented with proper hand hygiene.

Locals have identified this resource of the region and have relied on traditional beekeeping methods as a primary source of income generation for ages. When the time comes to harvest the honey, beekeepers use fire to kill the bees in order to safely extract the honey.

This traditional method is an extremely harmful beekeeping practice because it shrinks the region's bee population and damages the environment. Locals use this destructive method due to a lack of education in two important areas.  First, farmers practicing beekeeping are uninformed of the value that protecting bees will have on their crops. Bees pollinate one third of all fruits and vegetables consumed by humans, so promoting bee population will improve and increase the local food supply. Second, most locals are unaware of other extraction options and beekeeping methods.  For example, the smoker extraction technique is a safer, healthier practice for the beekeeper, the bees and the environment. Smoke is blown near the hive to confuse the bees and make them retreat out of fear of a fire. Furthermore, there are more efficient beehive designs that exponentially increase honey output.  One such design is the Langstroth beehive, also referred to as the movable frame hive, which can be produced using local materials, making it more cost-efficient.  

During a three-day workshop, a collection of 10 groups of farmers and female entrepreneurs will be trained on the environmental impact of honeybees and on the construction of the Langstroth beehive and smoker extraction devices.  The workshop will also cover basic business strategies to help groups manage beekeeping accounts.  

During the training, participants will have the opportunity to build their own movable frame beehives and then each group will take one hive with them after successful completion of training.

The majority of the population makes a living in agriculture and raising cattle, and almost all families use wood-burning ovens to cook the basic grains they produce. Because most of the land has been cleared for farming, there are fewer and fewer areas that still support tree growth, and because of the increasing need for wood for cooking and baking, this precious resource is rapidly deteriorating. 
<BR><BR>
Families that bake tend to use much higher amounts of firewood compared to other families, and thus contribute the most to deforestation, of which NGOs have documented annual decreases in forested area from 7% to 50% annual decline.  Deforestation has led to many other ecological and economic issues, namely erosion, depletion of local water sources, such as creeks, and economic costs of replenishing these depleted resources.

The project pinpoints families that use the most wood, namely families that bake regularly, in order to have a more profound effect on resources, such as local forests and creeks, which are used by the entire community. As such, the 15 beneficiaries are requesting Partnership’s assistance to build 15 improved ovens made from old oil barrels, bricks, adobe dirt, and iron bars. By the beneficiaries utilizing the fuel efficient oven design, they will use at least 30% less wood annually, slowing deforestation and saving money and labor, while at the same time using the ovens for income generation, mainly in the sale of baked goods.

Other meals include, khoki and plantains, rice and stew, cabbage and plantains (or cabbage with fufu corn), and ndole with plantains.  These traditional meals of garri, fufu and eru, fufu corn, polished yams, or rice and stew, are all starch based. Most parents complain that their inability to provide those important nutritious values to their children results from their lack of funds.

Unfortunately, thirteen families, located in the remote outskirts of town, do not have access to this utility. Currently, these community members use flashlights, kerosene lamps, and candles to light their homes. We believe solar panels are the solution. The systems will not only provide light, but reduce environmental impacts, improve health, and reduce energy-associated costs. For example, there will be a diminished dependence on batteries purchased for flashlights, which contain toxic heavy metals. The batteries are often carelessly disposed of on the ground, into river systems, or are burned. There, they break down and become hazardous waste that leaches into the ground and waterways, thus polluting the water we drink and the air we breathe. The toxic fumes associated with burning kerosene lamps indoors can lead to serious health problems which include lung diseases such as emphysema and pneumonia or eye infections like cataracts. Solar is a simple, smart and viable option that can drastically improve the quality of life for these humble stakeholders.

Students cannot be promoted to the next grade without passing English and most tertiary school programs require a pass in English. Strong English skills are also required for success in all other subjects because both instruction and examination is done using English. The community has identified this as a critical area of improvement. 
<BR><BR>
The project has three major components: first is to develop a system for organizing the library books the school currently owns; second is to construct a library building that is spacious enough to harbor clearly distinguishable levels and types of books, and also to accommodate for students to study in groups or individually; third is to familiarize the students and teachers with the library through holding training sessions, in order for them to best be able to utilize it. 
<BR><BR>
With an organized and spacious library, comes the possibility for students to check out books and continue their learning outside of the classroom. We hope this will increase students' motivation to take responsibility and interest in their education through reading and learning on their own time. A system has been created and will be implemented for teachers to help run the library during designated school hours, allowing students to check in and out books.

Through community education, regular trash collection, organic composting, opportunities for recycling, neighborhood clean-ups, and a park revival, the goal is a cleaner and healthier environment in a community that is conscientious of their environmental impact and how it affects their health.
<BR><BR>
Objectives:
1. Separation of household waste into 3 categories - 1.) Organic Trash 2.) Recyclables 3.) Trash
2. Community education about the importance of trash management for their health and environment
3. Providing sufficient trash cans so they do not overflow
4. Creation of compost centers managed by the community 
5. Creation of a fun and safe gathering place for the community
<BR><BR>
Community members will provide labor, and community leaders will be trained to carry out education and maintenance. The project will provide health and environmental benefits. Currently there are improvised dumps where trash will sit for weeks.  This is a breeding ground for pests including mosquitos that carry dengue, as well as a place for leachate to form and contaminate the ground water source. Utilizing organic waste as compost will lower the amount of trash accumulated.  More trash cans will provide citizens more places to responsibly dispose of their trash.  And regular collection service will ensure that trash is not sitting outside as a health and environmental risk.  Education will provide understanding of the importance of proper trash management within the community. The park beautification will help create an identity that reflects environmental awareness and community pride.",SD,9067.50,79,2388.63,0,17-JAN-13,Water & Sanitation,Water Sanitation-Other,2015-03-25T00:00:00

The department aims to strengthen its programs and empower its participants through the critical analysis of gender roles. The results of a needs assessment at ITEd highlighted deficiencies in resources in the areas of journalism, home economics, and library holdings. Further assessment in each program shows not only a lack of resources, but also a lack of gender diversity. Tying these programs together under the project, Integrated Student Development (ISD), will provide students with a holistic education that forces them to confront traditional gender norms in the Philippines, thereby equipping them with the knowledge and skills to redefine these prescribed roles. 
<BR><BR>
Not only will students have exposure to a multidisciplinary program, but the programs will also create a synergy through targeted activities that will ensure future sustainability.  The journalism program would print advertisements highlighting the benefits of the home economics program. The newly exposed home economics program would then host a bake sale to raise money for library holdings resources. Finally, the library would provide informational resources for the journalism students in the production of their school paper. Consolidating these programs into a single conceptual framework will foster a more unified institute through improved communication and interdisciplinary studies.

The community, educators, and principal are concerned with the large amount of teenage girls who have become pregnant after graduating from the school.  There is no health curriculum or after school program in place to educate the girls about becoming women.

There are many young mothers who live in that village that would like the opportunity to mentor female students at the primary school.  They feel as if they could have achieved and experienced more in their lives if they had waited to have children.  The young mothers wish that someone had educated them about the consequences of their behavior, not only regarding pregnancy, but the risk of contracting HIV/AIDs as well.

The purpose of this project is to develop an after school program for the female students attending the primary school.  Mentors from the village will run the weekly sessions and employed females from various professions will act as guest speakers, sharing how they achieved success.  Additional meetings will cover topics such as: healthy living, female empowerment, risk management, self esteem, goal setting, and teen pregnancy/ STDs.  The girls will also communicate with other villages through a penpal letter exchange between neighboring Peace Corps Volunteers.

The participants in this group will benefit from the sharing of knowledge and experience among female community members, in a safe supportive environment.

Daily activities, workshops and games will fit into the five themes of the camp: identity, health, environment, gender and future. By the end of the week, the girls will be able to assess and reevaluate their personal goals and issues facing their respective communities, while analyzing the best way to reach their maximum potential. During the week, various guest speakers will lead discussions so the girls have an opportunity to meet successful local women who have overcome cultural norms as well as progressive-thinking men whom support such efforts for a better future for all. High-achieving host country national counselors have volunteered to guide the campers through their processing of each session.

LIFE Camp will promote healthy lifestyles and social consciousness amongst its participants and will arm campers with the project design skills to disseminate their newly gained knowledge throughout their communities. 
<BR><BR>
Goals: The goal of LIFE Camp is two-fold.   First, we aim to increase our participants' awareness of what constitutes a healthy lifestyle and to enhance their leadership skills.  The second goal is for our participants to demonstrate those acquired leadership skills by developing and implementing health-related projects in their communities to disseminate their new knowledge to their peers and community members.  Training young boys and girls to take ownership of their knowledge and education in this way vastly increases the likelihood that they will assimilate healthy lifestyle choices into their everyday lives.  Equally important, it helps students to comprehend their own potential as leaders amongst their peers and within their communities.
<BR><BR>
Project Schedule: The LIFE team recognizes the scarcity of funding for civic engagement and healthy lifestyle projects in Georgia and is therefor taking steps to ensure that any funding we receive is used in a camp composed of tested and perfected trainings.  For two years, LIFE Camp has been conducted throughout Georgia and our trainings and materials are in a constant state of improvement.  This year, we plan to implement 4 unfunded camps in June and early July in order to fully test and perfect our materials.  Following these camps, we will conduct a one-week long, overnight trip to a nearby community.  This funded camp will bring together 36 Georgian youths ages 13-16 from all over the country as well as 4 Georgian counselors.  These participants will attend sessions in which they will be encouraged to enhance their leadership skills through activities that raise their awareness of common problems throughout Georgia.  These sessions include: drug and tobacco awareness, alcohol consumption, healthy eating habits, physical fitness, gender roles (including discussions of domestic violence), sexually transmitted diseases, and general hygiene.  In weeks after our camp, we will connect all participants through social networks so that they can support each other in their efforts to disseminate this important information throughout their communities.",MI,2903.42,45,3544.33,0,08-JUL-2014,Youth Development,Camps,2015-03-25T00:00:00

A Learning Resource Center would entail the creation of a functioning library and computer lab. Currently the school has no means for its students or teachers to research topics or to access additional information in the form of textual or internet resources.  The Learning Resource Center would enable the school to provide textual resources to its population as well as conduct effective computer classes for its students, teachers and community members. The construction of a Learning Resource Center would allow students not only to increase their literacy in all subjects, but also to increase the overall level of education provided to the constituents of the school.

With the help of the Partnership Program in the past we were able to buy a large plot of land along with the building of one classroom, a kitchen and storage space. We hope to expand on this project to build two additional classrooms and an office. Since the building of the preschool in 2010 the numbers of students has grown. We are now teaching 89 children.  Being the only preschool in the local district, the community has benefited greatly, and parents contribute monthly to keep it running. Their contribution pays for lunch, water, as well as the monthly income of our teachers. Unfortunately it isn't enough to help us with our goals for expanding the school. 
<BR><BR>
In this local community, many children grow up speaking Chichewa and do not learn Portuguese until they have entered primary school. Most students do not start learning English until secondary school, which is at times too late for most of them to become fluent. Nowadays many Mozambicans wish to learn English because of job opportunities, given that English speaking countries surround Mozambique. LAL Preschool has been providing their students with an introduction to English and Portuguese and the children are greatly exceeding the expectation of the teachers.
<BR><BR>
We would like to use the new classrooms for different age groups. 2/3 year olds and 4/5 year olds. Once those classrooms are built we hope to turn our current classroom into a dining hall for the children. In addition, we would like to build a small administrative block because as of now there is no space to keep records of payment for the parents, records for the teachers, books, school materials, etc.
<BR><BR>
The founders of the preschool, want to give a quality education to the young children of the community. Presently their school has not met their own standards of what an early childhood centre should be. With the many children enrolling in the preschool they feel if they are not able to expand on their project soon, they will not be able to give their students the quality education they thrive for everyday. Mozambique hopes for well-educated and well-qualified future leaders; therefore a good early child education centre is a start to making that happen for this community.

It began with the board of governors of a local Youth Polytechnic and Secondary School in Gem district, Nyanza Province. During meetings they had both expressed the need for a community library. They saw several similar problems and disparities related to book availability. One problem is a lack of books for students which included both textbooks and reference book material. Another related concern was the poor english literacy of the students, especially in younger forms and primary schools. This leads to misunderstanding between the teacher and student as well as challenges taking exams as all exams are written in English. The English teacher said her biggest challenge of teaching form ones is their poor literacy. The third is an interest in reading but lack of leisure-reading material or a disinterest in reading all together. This project has a goal to tackle these problems by supplying  25,000 books to schools and/or communities with libraries by 2014. Ten thousand of these will go to the local Community Library. The project will involve Peace Corps volunteers and their communities in various regions of Kenya. The shipment of books will contain 25,000 and each Volunteer's community will receive 1,000 books, hence 15 Volunteers will be involved. An international NGO will be donating the books and the schools/communities will be responsible for raising money for shipping costs and transporting the books once they arrive.

With the project's improvements, students will be able to check out books for pleasure in both Khmer and English, as well as use the room as a study space.

Worsening the situation is the fact that community members do not have the skills necessary to pursue jobs outside of the community, such as basic literacy in Spanish and computer skills.  As a result, the majority of the young adults migrate to Argentina to work as menial labors or maids, sending money home to support their families.  The community has identified the need for a library and a computer center with the hope that, by giving their children a better education and more marketable skills, they will be able to find jobs in the nearby city of Villarrica rather than continue to migrate to other countries for work or to labor in the fields.

Before the start of the new school year, the girls come to Linguere from their respective villages to spend two days learning about money management, planning for the future, social diversity, and health issues. Senegalese speakers come to discuss and engage the girls in each topic. The second day, parents are invited to come and see their daughters' accomplishments and also to engage them in a discussion of the importance of school. The girls have a chance to sit down with their parents to explain why they want to continue school and what they would like to do with their education. The hope of this seminar is to encourage girls to be true to themselves whether that be becoming a doctor, a business owner, or a mother. Whatever their aspirations, we want to help them be confident and true to their paths.",NY,1045.92,34,2017.7,0,29-SEP-14,Gender and Development,Conference,2015-03-25T00:00:00

The Buenavista National High School Environmental Club is using the concept of delivery in their plan to spread environmental awareness throughout their community. Little Big Change (LBC) is a mobile project aimed to educate the rural communities of Buenavista about the effects of improper waste management and to offer alternative solutions. 
Buenavista is located on one of the thousands of islands peppered throughout the Philippine Archipelago, in the most biologically diverse area on the planet. Despite this global importance, however, it is threatened by the mismanagement of waste and pollution. The Club has identified solid waste management as a concern in their town and plans to produce an awareness video, aimed for an audience of the youth.
BNHS is composed of the main school near the town center and four small annex schools located in far, remote areas of the municipality. Taking advantage of this network, the Club intends to travel to each of the annexes where they will deliver videos they produced (in the native language) and conduct a workshop regarding solid waste management. The Club members will be responsible for the video design, production, and showing, along with the discussion and follow-up activities held thereafter.

The local commune is located in the southeast and is primarily agricultural with small business such as tailor shops and hairdressers dominating the center. The women's group Besensia is composed of 17 professional women members in the commune; it was created in 2000 with the goals of promoting the women and girls contributing to the improvement of the lives of rural women.  Besensia hosts training sessions on topics including basic accounting, money management, collaborative organization, and gardening which bring in members from surrounding communities.  The living fence will be constructed around a parcel of land (53 m x 60 m) adjacent to the center that is used for gardening. Local gardens are prone to damage from human and animal traffic that often decreases the garden's productivity and yield.  Furthermore, deforestation has become an increasing problem in this region as the majority of households continue to rely on wood collected in forests as fuel for cooking. The living fence will serve as a model to the community of a low cost, simple, and sustainable method of creating a permanent barrier to protect gardens while simultaneously reintroducing trees to the environment.  Besensia members, training session participants, and community members all stand to benefit from this project. The funds will be used to purchase two native tree species, Campecher and Pourgais.  Campecher seedlings and Pourgais seeds will be planted in double staggered rows with 40 cm between plants and between each row.  Grafted mango, Terminalia, and Moringa trees will be included to demonstrate additional benefits of a living fence, notably as a source of food and shade.

Since then, students, under the supervision of teachers and PTA members with information technology expertise, have managed to repair 7 computers.  The internet tower and the other 13 computers were beyond repair.

As the internet and computers were widely used in the high school's curriculum prior to Yolanda by both students and teachers, they have attempted, without success to date, to find possible donors for replacement of the totally damaged internet tower and computers.  As such, the high school's curriculum has suffered.

The rate of infection is the third highest in the world and it mainly affects people aged 20-45. These people are the youth, parents, and workers of the communities sprinkled throughout Lesotho. Though it’s true HIV/AIDS can affect anyone, it’s clear that it’s spreading faster with people who live in poverty and lack access to education, basic health services, and nutrition. Although HIV/AIDS has become common in most every community in Lesotho, the disease is still surrounded by silence. People are embarrassed to speak about being infected. People living with AIDS are exposed to daily prejudice born out of ignorance and fear. The only way to slow this epidemic is to break the silence and remove the stigma that surrounds it.  At a small technical school near the center of Lesotho, we plan to do just that. We hope to tackle this problem through the creation of a holistic health club that will broach topics of sexual education and mental health while providing a non-threatening environment for anybody, of any age and status to come exercise. The surrounding community is providing a building to house the health club and a local nursing school is lending their students to help educate the community with monthly forums.

Typically, trash is burned in piles with a child or student, watching over it.  During the week, trash is just kept in piles around the compound and market, which leads to it being picked through by animals for food, children for ""toys"", and blown away by the wind.  Ghanaians know the importance of keeping the environment clean, but generally lack the resources to do so.  The main aspect of the project is to build six small-scale, low-tech incinerators using locally available materials, to be placed in strategic locations in the village.  The students will lead a community-wide education event and trash pickup to educate the general public and sanitation workers about the incinerators as a locally available solution to waste management.

1. Planning/Group Organization <BR>
2. Small-Business/Product Training <BR>
3. Business Start-up <BR>
4. Expansion
<BR><BR>
It addresses three specific goals which are supported by measurable objectives to benefit the women and children of my community. 
<BR><BR>
The goals of Making Baking Make Cents include: <BR>
1. Increase women's monthly household income by 25% in five months <BR>
2. Provide business and leadership training to 12 women in 5 months <BR>
3. Be the example of small business in the community by developing and selling one additional product, complimentary to bread and training 4 additional women in the business.
<BR><BR>
Stage one of this project is complete.  The women have been working together by meeting twice a month since January to save money for supplies, schedule trainings and identify potential locations for vending.
<BR><BR>
Stage two is currently under way, as the women are in collaboration with an organization which has provided introductory trainings on bread-making and building small business essentials.  They have also identified a local baker who will be contracted to teach a workshop for the women in the future. 
<BR><BR>
This grant will provide additional trainings for stage 2 and support stage 3 which includes purchasing essential start-up appliances, tools, and materials for bread-making.
<BR><BR>
The objectives of the aforementioned goals are as follows: 
<BR><BR>
Goal 1: <BR>
-Increase women's household income by 25% <BR>
-Use basic business strategies learned in trainings to sell bread education <BR>
-Identify 2 or more profitable locations for selling with a community map of ""high traffic"" areas
<BR><BR>
Goal 2: <BR>
-Provide business and leadership training <BR>
-Host trainings twice a month focusing on one topic per month (Bookkeeping, Business Basics, Cost analysis, Teamwork and Responsibility) <BR>
-Learn and implement 4 different types of bread from a workshop given by a local baker <BR>
-Reinvest 10% of total group earnings in business maintenance and continuing education
<BR><BR>
Goal 3: <BR>
-Be an example for small businesses in the community <BR>
-Visit 1 other bread-making operation in the area to learn new cost effective techniques <BR>
-Train 4 additional women in business and leadership <BR>
-Develop one additional product which is complimentary to bread-making 
<BR><BR>
When stage 3 is complete and established we will move into the expansion stage (4) that will develop other products such as jams or beverages that compliment bread-making and increase vending opportunities.
<BR><BR>
The community continues to support this project by purchasing ""sample bread"" from the women and by offering space in their homes and ovens for training purposes. The women and Volunteers in the community are currently drafting plans for the construction of a community center which will include a dedicated space to house the complete operations of a functioning bread shop. The community is also supplying all of the raw material need to bake bread through cash or in-kind donations. They are in full support of a successful bread shop.

There are 64 people in the community who will directly benefit from the success of the 12 women who invest their time and energy into the bread shop.

This along with human interaction like pollution, over fishing, development of coastal environments and devastating fishing practices such as cyanide and dynamite all have significant effects on ocean life here in the Philippines. It is impossible to predict the full suite of responses of organisms inside and outside Marine Protected Areas (MPAs), or the exact changes within and around MPAs. This, along with the many unknowns about the ever-changing reality of ocean ecosystems, presents a need to monitor these areas regularly. The opportunity to assess the achievements / benefits, and or failures, of the MPAs, within the Municipal waters of this community; the local government along with other stakeholders including, the Interim Marine Protected Area Management Board (IMPAMB), can make management decisions to better govern the progress and economic implication of the MPAs. 
<BR><BR>
The project aim is to train approximately two members of the IMPAMB to assess the plants, invertebrates, habitat attributes and approximate numbers of fish species in a given area.  This will be followed up by fisher folk interviews that help management entities understand socio economic implications of these MPAs as well.  The assessments will then be given to the IMPAMB to help create a more comprehensive and sustainable marine resource project approach.

Marine Protected Areas can increase the fish yield of a community drastically (average of 188% increase in the Philippines).

The goal of this 6 day camp is to introduce girls to life skills that they are not often taught about in their home communities and support young women from a very conservative culture in their quest to improve their quality of life. This means teaching the girls about empowerment through things like future planning and goal setting, teaching them about their bodies through intensive reproductive health sessions and a violence against women session, and to promote education through positive role models and career sessions. The camp is also meant to be fun, and the girls will engage in dance-based activities, learn about other cultures, draw and create, and have a daily sports activity. 
<BR><BR>
Nine different communities are involved in this project, with each sending three girls and one chaperone to the camp. The school directors, parents and community leaders have been very supportive of the camp. Each session of the camp will be given by a host country national working in conjunction with a volunteer, increasing the capacity of presenters and serving as resources and role models for the girls. The camp will again be held at a local Community Educational Center, where we have a good working relationship with the director. We chose this facility due to its location in the impacted zone and its role as an important employer of local women.

It is perhaps the single most deciding factor when it comes to economic and social advancement across continents and cultures.  Unfortunately, in most of the world's countries there is still room for progress when it comes to women's rights, and this is painfully true in Burkina Faso.  Women here are categorically less represented in almost every sphere of public life, and are exceedingly vulnerable to violence.  Volunteers are all too familiar with the ways gender inequality and gender based violence can obstruct development and prevent many women from leading fully rich and satisfying lives. 
<BR> <BR>
The Men as Partners (MAP) Conference is a capacity building initiative that seeks to promote increased gender equality and implicate men in addressing the health and gender issues that affect their families and communities.  The conference lasts 3.5 days and is expected to reach 12-15 participants who will attend with Peace Corps volunteer counterparts.  Sessions will be adapted from the international Men as Partners Manual and each will be facilitated either entirely by Burkinabe organizers or co-facilitated by a Burkinabe organizer and volunteer counterpart.  The conference is designed to establish a nationwide capacity building network that includes volunteers, participants, facilitators, and community members, and to empower men to be more active participants in gender and development work. 
<BR><BR><BR>
The MAP Conference will address a breadth of objectives including:
<BR>
I.	Promoting gender equality: Participants will acquire a better understanding of sex and gender and discuss the negative consequences of inequality and stereotyping.
<BR>
II.	Promoting healthy lifestyles: Participants will learn and adopt practices to prevent the spread of HIV/AIDS and malaria, avoid unwanted pregnancy, prevent disease by maintaining a sanitary home environment, and discuss the advantages of proper family planning.   They will also learn strategies to address health issues in their communities.
<BR>
III.	Fostering a continued dialogue about gender and health issues in Burkina Faso: Volunteers, participants, and Burkinabe facilitators will become more comfortable discussing gender and health related topics in their communities and improve their organizing and facilitating skills.  Participants will return to site with action plans.
<BR>
IV.	Empowering men to recognize and take steps to reduce Gender Based Violence: Participants will identify the types of violence, discuss its negative consequences, and practice implementing the 6 steps of the bystander intervention method.   
<BR>
V.	Promoting men's participation in family life: Participants will discuss the advantages of men's active engagement in the family and identify the attributes of healthy relationships.

However, many people in the area lack training about how to use Moringas. The five neighboring towns would also like to plant Moringa trees at their schools.
<br><br>
The goals of this project are to provide revenue to local schools for educational materials and to increase the nutritional content of student diets.
<br><br>
There are two components to the project:
<br><br>
First, the grant will provide Moringa trees to 74 elementary and middle schools in the 5 communes surrounding the area. Each school will receive 50 trees. Moringa trees produce seeds that can be sold to a nearby oil manufacturer, thus providing local schools with a sustainable revenue stream. In classrooms that often have no desks and few notebooks or pens, this will greatly improve the quality of education. Moreover, Moringa trees are an excellent source of nutrients, and their leaves can be used to supplement the diets of students in a region that suffers from malnutrition.
<br><br>
Second, the grant will provide funding for a one-day training session about how to grow, care for, and use the trees. The five communes of the area will each send three people to the training. These will be local leaders in the fields of education and health. The training session will be led by representatives from local associations, NGOs, and the government. Grant funding will provide food and transportation for the participants.

The upcoming season will allow youth to build such KSAs (knowledge, skills, and abilities) through training and competition.
<br><br>
American flag football began in Morocco in 2010 when a group of youth approached a Peace Corps Volunteer (PCV) with the idea of starting a team. Over the next 2 years, the sport grew and spread throughout the region among the enthusiastic youth with the help of PCVs. The youth cooperated to coordinate their training and games.
<br><br>
The upcoming football season presents the league with a new dilemma: American flag football has grown in popularity throughout the region, and, in order to sustain this growth, the youth want to coordinate the league's first regular region-wide football season. The season will proceed in two stages:
<br><br>
First, the teams will train separately during the later summer months. They may play scrimmages with neighboring community teams if they choose to do so.
<br><br>
Second, the teams will play a regular season. There are 5 active teams in the league, and the season will be held in a series of 3 tournaments to motivate the players to continue training throughout the season. Trophies will be awarded to the top team at each tournament.

This problem concerns the safety of the students and faculty who must use these classrooms on a daily basis due to the lack of enough classrooms. Another problem, posed by the student to classroom ratio, is the faculty must schedule classes during the period allotted for extracurricular activities. This prevents students from participating in extracurricular activities which inhibits their academic success. As well, faculty must also hold classes from 5 pm to 7 pm most nights. The classrooms at the school do not have lights, so once the sun sets at 6:30 pm the teachers must release their classes shortening their time to teach their lessons and materials needed for the students' yearly exams.

Long stretches of dirt road separate towns from each other for hundreds of miles. An eastern province of Mongolia, located about 550 km away from the capital, Ulaanbaatar has a population of over 55,000.  Being such a long distance from the capital or other health care centers, the local General Hospital recognizes the need to have the best skilled medical workers and facilities possible. The idea of a nursing skill laboratory came from the hospital and health department nursing methodologists, wanting to improve the skills of the nurses and the care given to the patients.
<BR><BR>
As a registered nurse myself, I have seen the potential in the nursing staff as I have worked with them the last year and a half. We have done many seminars and trainings to improve their skill level. Creating the nursing skill laboratory will be an excellent way to build upon skills taught, using a more useful hands-on method. Having the training materials in the hospital will make it possible to bring in professionals to teach, rather than the expensive alternative of sending out nurses to other cities.
<BR><BR>
The hospital has agreed to donate a dedicated room for the skill laboratory, as well as two patient beds and disposable materials, such as IV tubing and needles for practice. The Partnership Program grant will go towards the training materials and supplies, such as a medical training dummy (which is a simulated human patient that will provide practice for nurses on skills such as injections, catheterization, and patient positioning), prosthetic arms for IV practice, IV stands, blood pressure cuffs, and transportation costs for the materials.

When the rainy season comes in November, rivers start to rise and become impassable by foot.  Swimming is avoided due to the presence of hungry crocodiles and fast flowing water, forcing many farmers to abandon their plots for 4 months during prime planting season.
<BR><BR>
With the support of three local communities, together we will plan, design, and build a 40 meter Suspended Pedestrian Trail Bridge with the purpose of not only providing a safe means for crossing a dangerous river all year long but to also stimulate local economies.  Strong enough for people, animals, bicycles, and even motorcycles, a bridge in the proposed location would allow farmers to use the fertile land on the opposite side to continue their subsistence farming and start profiting from cash crops like cotton, as well.  Additionally, it would also provide those living on the far side of the river with convenient access to a hospital and specialized medical posts, secondary schools, a diverse market and the main transportation hub.",MD,3515.00,26,9957,0,07-JAN-14,Municipal Development,Infrastructure,2015-03-25T00:00:00

There is a growing issue in the communities of young students with subject learning difficulties. Many do not feel comfortable asking adults for extra help, or it is not available to them. Thus they drop out of school, retake classes, or become too discouraged to participate. In response to this issue, the organization plans to begin a peer tutoring program as a way to address the needs of these students. Through peer education, young tutors can work one-on-one in a non-formal setting to aid students in more difficult subjects, while developing social relationships and building their self-confidence. Multiple studies show that students feel most comfortable with peers their own age, and are more likely to open up to peer tutors and communicate their difficulties. This annual program will empower 45 demonstrated Supreme Pupil Government leaders of 7 elementary schools and members of the local organization to act as peer tutors for 80 students with scores of 77% and below in math, science, and English. The program includes an annual training for the tutors introducing peer education and literacy. Tutors will schedule weekly sessions with their students and will plan fun review and practice activities to help the student find easier ways to learn material. Access to worksheets will be offered by the organization and teachers. Teachers and community mobilizers will monitor the sessions, most of which take place at the schools, as they already have remedial schedules in place. Otherwise sessions will be held at the student's home. To ensure retention to the program, the organization will provide monthly school incentives to the tutors at their schools and will recognize them, along with the most improved students, with plaques at their annual closing ceremony.",OH,686.52,80,176.3,0,,Education,Extra-curricular,2015-03-25T00:00:00

In our town, child trafficking and slavery are ongoing problems.  As a way to assist children that have been sold into slavery and have been forced to work in the fishing industry, local residents have founded an orphanage/primary school which rescues children from the region and provides short-term care solutions such as housing accommodations, education and skills training until the children are able to be re-united with their families.

Currently, there are 30 trafficked children living at the school.  Each child is completely dependent on outside donors for the cost of his or her lodging, health care, clothing and schooling.   The orphanage has no means of generating an income at this time. Because more and more children are being rescued in the region, the amount of money needed by the orphanage is increasing.

The center provides a safe, stimulating environment in which these students can learn necessary life skills.  Through this playground we hope to teach game and sports skills, and improve the students’ overall physical health.  This will be done both by building the playground and through workshops for the older students on first aid and workshops for the teachers on the importance of physical activity and cooperative games to play with students.

Many of the students lucky enough to go to school still find education a challenge as they do not have the proper supplies to make their time in school effective, such as the 73 students who do not have textbooks. To address this need, the school's head teacher has organized a library project committee from respected village elders and the school's 9 teachers who are requesting a PCPP grant of 2,619,008.00 TSH to complement the 1,239,008.00 TSH in community contribution (32.12%) to create a 3,858,000.00 TSH library. The committee plans to renovate a building currently unused with the donated skills of village craftsmen. Next, three teachers have volunteered to be trained in library management skills and will divide the hours of the library amongst themselves to keep it open during and after school. The new library will be filled with textbooks for every subject for every grade level so that students will gain the ability to increase their performance in school and on the NECTA exams to continue their education to the next level. The project committee wants to create a reference section within the library, as well.

Each school has a student body of 300 students and about 10 teachers. The majority of the time, students have to use their valuable school time to fetch water, which is keeping them away from their studies. In addition with water being a problem to get, students don't wash their hand after using the bathroom facilities, which makes spreading germs easy and increases the number of absences in the school due to students being sick. The proposed project is to build a hand washing stations for both the primary school and secondary school. These stations will be connected to a rain water catchment system, but also could be filled up manually. Each hand washing station will have three faucets, the tank will be 3,000 liters and will be connected a gutter system on one side of the building. The government and school board designed this project because of the positive outcome from the smilarly designed water catchment system built at the health clinic earlier this year.

Its purpose is to help close the gender gap in education, as many girls drop out due to early marriage or pregnancy, or to help with housework, particularly during the middle school years. The scholarship provides money for school inscription fees and school supplies for girls at each participating middle school, in order to decrease some of the financial barriers to school attendance for families.  Administrative staff at each school work with the volunteers to select nine candidates (three girls each from 6eme, 5eme, and 4eme grade levels) based on a combination of academic standing and financial need. The application process includes a personal essay, interview, submission of the candidate's grades, teacher recommendations, and a home visit. Two methods of administering the program were available this year - a selective method in which all the candidates have a certain amount of their inscription fees paid for, and then a selection committee approves three winners (one from each grade level) to receive school supplies based on the candidates’ applications and the following criteria: strong motivation, demonstrated ability, lack of financial support, and lack of familial support. The alternative, a new ""equality method"", was introduced this year in which the funding for inscription fees and school supplies are split evenly among the nine candidates. Volunteers are required to ensure that the scholarship money is used for inscription fees and school supplies, to distribute certificates and/or organize a congratulatory ceremony, and plan for follow-up activities such as girls' clubs, camps, career panels, life skills curricula, sexual health causerie, or sensibilisation with a staff member based on information collected during the application process. This follow-up work strengthens the students' commitment to remain in school, and encourages them to plan for their future, thereby increasing the capacity-building aspect of the program for participants.

Currently there is no place for youth and adults to gather. Children play in the street at night where the sun sets at 6:00pm. The road running through the village is also a major highway and large cargo trucks run rapidly day and night. This, coupled with the absence of a shoulder on the road creates an extremely dangerous situation.  There no park in the community because of the landscape.
<BR><BR>
The average width of the community ridge is 60 meters from slope to slope and there are few areas where a park would be feasible. However, we found one location that could be converted into a park. A cooperative of the village has generously donated the land for a central park, a triangular piece of property in the middle of town with enough area to accommodate soccer and basketball courts and a playground. The total area of the park will be 315mn (soccer/basketball court - 160m and a playground - 255m). This will permit children and their parents to have enjoyable and safe play and a gathering area. 
<BR><BR>
This project will use the foundation of the current kindergarten for the court. We will then remodel the adjacent building to create a bigger and updated kindergarten classroom. It will have much needed additional space; presently 35 students share only 196 sq. ft.

Because of the school's location at a busy village crossroads, children are exposed to frequent and fast motorcycle and car traffick, as well as bicycles, donkey carts, and pedestrians.  Animals wander through the space during and after school, leaving their droppings behind.  Older, heavier children invade the playground when school is not in session and have broken much of the play equipment.  The pre-school children wander beyond the playground limits chasing balls or each other.  Tree seedlings planted by the parents to border the pre-school are still struggling to survive hungry goats, clumsy cows, and swerving vehicles.

Parents, the steering committee, community members, and the mayor's office have committed funding and labor toward the project.  To ensure high quality work, the steering committee has selected a contractor who has already completed similar, well-built projects in the village.  The parents committee and pre-school will maintain the fence.  A protective fence will eliminate threats to the children's safety and security, and will provide a positive and inviting place to learn and play.

Clean water is important for the health of our students and community and is also important for us to use in the science laboratory.  However, clean water can often be a problem; many times the rivers and streams are full of mud, soap from washing or chemicals from the farms.  Other times, there is a little water because during the dry season the water level in the ground is low, causing springs to lay dry
<BR><BR>
Because the school is dedicated to helping the students live healthy lives and also to providing a strong science education, the community would like to build a rain harvesting system and water tank so they can have clean water to use throughout the year.  The water collected will be used in the school kitchen for clean water to cook students’ and staff lunches and for clean water to drink in the school garden to grow vegetables for school production even during the dry season and in the school science laboratory to improve science education.

The secondary school will supply the project with local materials such as rocks and gravel, sand and water for bricks, wood boards, a portion of the labor and the land.  Financial assistance is needed for construction of the gutters which will be attached to the laboratory and in building the water tank.  Grant funds will be used to purchase gutters, pipes, cement, a portion of the labor and additional building supplies.

Frustration level readers can identify one syllable words and reads using an index finger one letter at a time with little comprehension level.  Non-reader students are those that can hardly identify the syllables.

The river runs through 12 different quarters of the urban center of the community, and due to population expansion, families have cleared the vegetation surrounding the river to build their houses. The Prefecture Office of Water & Forests, the Prefecture Administrative Government and the chiefs of the quarters will conduct field assessments to determine the degradation and number/type of trees to plant for each family, will organize the planning and group meetings, will provide the land for the tree nursery and will perform the two trainings for the riverside families. The first training will emphasize the ecological services that a healthy riverbed will provide and the second training will introduce alternative options for fuel rather than firewood and improved stoves or solar cookers to reduce lumber consumption.
<BR><BR>
The trees will be grown in a nursery and then will be given to each individual family freely in exchange for their taking care of their trees.  Fruit trees and moringa will be given as an incentive for each family to protect their trees with forest species planted on rocky terrains.  The riverine families along the riverbed will directly benefit from the reforestation.  Reforesting the riverbed will prevent flooding in the houses during the rainy season, will counter erosion and desertification, will increase soil fertility for agriculture from the branches and leaves, will purify the water for multiple uses, will provide shade during the dry season, and will give fruits, fibers and holistic medicines.  Moringa is especially beneficial because the leaves provide enough calcium, iron, protein, potassium, and other vitamins to effectively counter malnutrition, and it is used as medicine to alleviate heart disease, high blood pressure, high cholestrol, diabetes, ulcers, and bacterial or fungal infections.  Moringa also has tap roots which will grow downward rather than sideways, making them ideal for planting along houses in limited spaces.  Because moringa is drought-resistant and prefers drier climates they will be planted more inland closer to the buildings.

Due to lack of space, this old building is also sometimes used for small surgeries and serves as temporary housing for apprentices, despite the unsafe and unhealthy nature of the building. The roof is caving in and leaks when it rains, specifically in the office where vaccinations take place and birth and vaccination records are stored. Furthermore, the pharmacy is currently located across a busy, dangerous road so patients and pregnant women are forced to cross it multiple times during their visit. The volunteer and medical staff hope a renovated building will provide more space for a better functioning and safer health center and will encourage more people to come, specifically for women on baby-weighing
and vaccination days and women ready to give birth. During project development, the community identified its greatest health issues as pre- and post-natal care, dangerous at-home births, malaria, nutrition, and reventable sanitation-related diseases like diarrhea and stomach parasites. To address these issues, the center will serve a dual-purpose: An extension of the existing health center, with offices for the government-authorized employees, patient rooms and a pharmacy; and a training center for sanitation and nutrition programs.

The village wants a health center they can feel safe visiting and can be proud of; they simply do not have the means to make this possible on their own. The PCV has been blown away by the staff and the community so far during this project and believes now more than ever, they deserve a fully-functioning hospital. Please donate to their effort and help make this a center where patients can stay overnight, mothers and babies can be vaccinated in a safe environment, mothers learn new ways to nourish their children, and villagers transform their own lives with better health and nutrition.

There are not many girls' schools beyond the primary level in this geographical region, and this school is the only one that provides national examinations along with vocational training. We offer courses of study in the commercial and liberal arts as well as training in domestic sciences. This allows the students opportunities for academic and occupational success. 
<BR><BR>
Unfortunately during the devastating 10 year war in Sierra Leone, the school's buildings and equipment were ransacked. Since then the school has been working hard to achieve its former standard. Funds from the partnership would allow the school to finish rehabilitation of the domestic sciences. 
<BR><BR>
Having rehabilitated school classrooms, the boarding home, latrines, and well, the staff now wants to focus on the school's signature domestic science program. The majority of our students are enrolled in this program but without proper equipment they sew clothes by hand and cook over an open fire. The partnership funds would allow for the purchase of foot pump sewing machines, firewood burning stoves, and other equipment that would greatly enhance the student's vocational training. The school will contribute construction materials to repair the building itself and pay all workmanship costs. The domestic science staff will follow the physical rehabilitation with a programmatic one and reformat the standards and level of practical training for the students. After implementing this project the school will have the supplies to succeed in the coming years.

Thousands of students and teachers call the school their alma mater, and the community takes pride in its longstanding existence and accomplishments. Unfortunately, they can't say as much for its state of disrepair. Nestled in a serene spot up the tropical mountainside, the colonial structure has had to face half a century of heavy erosion from unrelenting winds and rainfall. Today, it barely stands on a collapsing foundation and bowed cracking pillars. Just recently a student shut one of the remaining classroom doors and the entire mud face of the wall crumbled down on him. Not only is the school not conducive for a learning environment, but the building itself is a safety hazard! When I arrived at my new village home, bringing with me new opportunities, renovating their school was at the top of the community's list. They advocated that restoring the school would help to boost dwindling enrollment numbers, nurture a constructive learning environment, grant space to obtain and store resources (like books!), and aid in the overall development of the students' academic and personal success. Having now taught there for half a year, I'd be hard-pressed to find a bigger advocate for the project than myself.

The manual and CD will be designed to complement the MINED curriculum that was implemented in 2006 and a training on their use will be incorporated into the workshops. The project asks for 121 manuals and CDs to be printed. However we are asking for 100 more copies so that if extra teachers show up at the trainings we will be able to give them a copy.  As a result, approximately 221 secondary public English teachers will receive training and a copy of the manual and CD for practical application of what they learn in the workshops.

There are no stairs leading up to the kindergarten classroom, leaving a dangerous drop from the room to the ground.
Some classrooms have no doors, which contribute to security problems at the school.
Paint and other small repairs are needed to improve the school's appearance.
Paint is also needed to add science images on the walls of the school to act as visual aids during science lessons, since not every student has a textbook.

Since I arrived in Vanuatu in December of 2008 with the title of Teacher Trainer, my focus has been on literacy. It was immediately obvious to me that more than just assisting with and modeling of teaching reading was necessary in creating a balanced, successful program. I saw one of the greatest needs was for the children to have the opportunity to read more, to be able to borrow books to take home. Although a library existed at the school, it needed to be restocked and reorganized and renovated and, most of all, needed to be used by all students. By having the opportunity to take books home on a weekly or even daily basis, I predicted that a huge change in the abilities in and attitudes towards reading would occur; I knew that the small amount of time being devoted to classroom reading instruction and general reading was not adequate. So, my work began, first by requesting friends in the U.S. to send books; the generosity has been incredible and I have received over 1200 books; the acquisition of these books has had a tremendous effect on the library; they have replaced many of the old, torn, mildewed, damp and damaged books that constituted the bulk of the collection; they have provided interesting, up-to-date, colorful, exciting, and appealing reading material in both the fiction and non-fiction genres and at all reading levels. The second major event, in addition to incorporating these new books into the library, has been preparing for the children to borrow books, from instructing them in the care of books, to how to carefully turn the pages, to transporting them to and from school, to asking their families' participation in assisting at home.

When discussing these issues, the teaching staff and community at the local Secondary School, we developed a multi-faceted program to address the aforementioned issues. The first part of the program is to start an apiary on the school property. Bees have taken up residence in the dormitories, school laboratory, and some classrooms.

Students and teachers will be trained in bee-keeping best practices by this organization to ensure a quality product is being developed in a sustainable means. Honey products will be sold directly to the partnering NGO for distribution in its established local and national markets.

This will significantly help them improve their computer skills, particularly with programs like Microsoft Word, Excel and PowerPoint. They will also learn how to access and navigate the Internet, which will offer students countless educational benefits, such as the ability to do research to further their own learning. Second, more students will be able to enroll in the course. The course is currently limited to 6th-8th graders, but with a new lab, the course can be offered 10th and 11th graders as well. By next school year, the school hopes to increase the number of students enrolled in the course from 312 to 1,000. 
<BR><BR>
The project will be implemented and sustained through a partnership between the school administration and the NGO. The administration has already designated a new, larger classroom for the lab and agreed to dedicate a portion of the annual school budget to pay for operational costs, maintenance and a secretary's salary. The NGO will be in charge of maintenance and providing technical assistance to the teachers. Money generated from lab services, such as photocopying and printing, will go towards buying additional equipment for the lab and community projects at the school. 
<BR><BR>
All donations will go directly to providing them with the necessary equipment and supplies for a new computer lab, including ten desktop computers, two photocopy machines, two printers, Internet USB keys, extension cables, an inverter and network cables.

With the construction of a computer lab, the local secondary school aims to make computers available for 900+ students and community members and introduce Information Technology courses into the 2015 curriculum.  The secondary school in this community was recently built and currently consists of only six classrooms--no computer lab, no library, no gymnasium or other facilities.  The school administration has elaborated a plan for the construction of these facilities, but these projects are on hold because of a lack of funds.  The student body and school administration have identified the construction of a computer lab as a priority, and a fundraising campaign has already begun to help raise funds for this project.  The community has committed a contribution of 30% of the expected costs in the forms of labor, materials, and financial support. If realized, this project will increase the accessibility of computer literacy courses to the students of the secondary school and members of the wider community.  Teachers who already have computer literacy knowledge will have the opportunity to not only pass on their knowledge to the students, but to train their colleagues in computer literacy as well, enabling Information Technology courses in the community to be locally sustainable.  With time and practice, increased computer access and understanding will increase the efficiency of the school administration and other local organizations and businesses.  This will connect this isolated, rural community to other communities and markets, contributing to the economic development of the area.

Non-potable water comes from a tap in the school grounds and they disinfect it by boiling; however, the tap runs dry for months at a time during the dry season (with a rainfall average of only 13 centimeters).  Students are taken out of class to walk at least two kilometers to fetch water from the closest spring or the river, which is contaminated with debris and bacteria.  With low access to clean water, students resort to drinking non-potable water.  Practically every day, at least one sick student is sent home.

Thirty years ago, a handful of families lived off of the land and sea, but now, as demand for workers has increased, thousands of families have moved from other communities in the Dominican Republic and Haiti to the area closest to the hotels. This community with virtually no public services miraculously holds over 10,000 people in a small geographic area. Social problems abound, which many attribute to the lack of public schools. A program to address this was initiated and directed by a local woman known to many simply as the “Godmother”. A poor woman herself, Lila strives to provide a positive and safe place for children to come on Saturdays. Although without many resources, Lila always finds a way to feed hungry children, clothe them for school and teach them values like friendship, love and caring for the environment. Lila designed this project—“Sewing Skills for Youth” as a way to teach 30 local youth, ages 12-18 how to create basic sewing projects and then market them in the community. The project will fund a sewing machine and start-up materials, and Lila will donate her time and knowledge to educate the youth. Projects that the youth make will be sold to both community members and tourists as a way for the youth to have an income source, as well as provide a fund for the continued development of the project.",FL,494.12,53,438.24,0,27-AUG-2008,Business Development,Bus-Training,2015-03-25T00:00:00

Successful participants will earn a certificate and have access to the video equipment and software for up to one year after the completion of the course.  

The central objective of the course is to create skilled practitioners of video production who can go on to find employment within this burgeoning, but highly unskilled, area of the Malagasy economy.   Students will be trained on modern equipment and use modern editing software, which will enhance the professionalism of their work.  They will learn basic small business skills, production techniques, and also hone their decision-making and time management skills, which will help them become competitive candidates in the short film-making industry.  

The project will be sustainable, as a community member will be trained to take over the role of the current course instructor, an international volunteer who will return home at the end of the school year.   The course will be managed by a well-established, well-run organization based at the local high school.

Peace Corps is returning to Sierra Leone after a period of extended civil war.  Soon after the civil war ended, the Government of Sierra Leone (GoSL) identified education as a national priority. Sierra Leone’s educational system has been transitioning from post-conflict resolution to sustainable development and working to provide quality and affordable education.  In response to this national priority, the Peace Corps’ initial return to Sierra Leone will focus on Secondary Education Volunteers teaching English, science, and math. 
<br><br>
In addressing prevalent needs in Sierra Leone, Peace Corps volunteers work hand in hand with their Sierra Leonean community and school counterparts in engaging the community to identify their priority needs and possible interventions. The community also identifies local resources and gaps within which external assistance is required.  Donations to the Country Fund will be utilized to help fill those gaps and provide additional resources.

The theme of future programming in Sierra Leone is strong and strategic growth. In 2012, a second project area may be added to complement the existing Secondary Education Project and Peace Corps will more than double the number of Volunteers in country. Future programming expansion will likely focus on community development, health education, agriculture, and food security, in keeping with GoSL priorities.

<BR><BR>
While the social enterprise café will operate as a typical for-profit business, its mission will be to serve the community and follow socially responsible business practices. The café will draw on the material and human resources in the settlement by buying and hiring locally, which will contribute to the economic growth in the settlement. The design and menu of the café will cater to a clientele of women and youth, an underserved portion of the settlement population in the food service sector. The café space will also serve as a cultural classroom for the community; hosting events and meetings, displaying local artwork, and hosting performances. 
The professional development training program will increase the employability of young adults in the settlement through theoretical and practical methods. The skills gained during the training program will be immediately utilized during an internship with a local business or organization. These internships will also expose the participants to job opportunities in the area; introducing them to the business managers and allowing for on-the-job training.

The main objective is to increase the knowledge, skills and resources of professionals at the center who work with children with developmental disabilities. After the completion of the project, the center will be equipped to conduct individual assessments and design individual interventions for each child with special needs.
<BR><BR>
Three main goals of the project are: To modify an existing assessment kit to make it applicable for use in a Filipino residential center; second, to train the psychologist to facilitate the assessment using the materials in a team setting; and third, for social workers at the center to develop individualized intervention plans based on the assessment outcome.
<BR><BR>
Indicators of success are: a well-designed and easy to use assessment kit; a professional at the center trained to facilitate the assessment within a team setting; and a individualized intervention plans for each resident.
<BR><BR>
To meet these goals funds are needed to improve the existing assessment kit. The social-emotional rating scale at the center should be translated in the local language, adapted for a residential setting, and the curriculum and materials updated for the staff to best work with the residents at the center.
<BR><BR>
The center has contributed considerable resources to the success and continuation of this project. Venue, human resources, labor, and the existing skills of the staff are at the disposal of this project.

Upon completing an order, the shipping of the baskets would also be greatly simplified, since all the baskets would be in one place.  Furthermore, extra space in the facility could be used to store surplus baskets, which could then be sold at a later time or used as samples for future orders.

We are planning a project around chickens in order to increase the food security, specifically in the form of chicken eggs and meat, and to supplement household income of community members.  Each of the 20 women in the group will receive materials to build a 4x4m (plus an additional 4x4m ""grazing area"") chicken coop.

<BR><BR>
In order to realize these goals, the women and I meet every two weeks to discuss plans, prepare for the arrival of materials, and cover chicken-related practices and management strategies. The women and I will continue to meet throughout the duration of the project for monitoring and evaluation.

Faced with these problems and through continuous information and education campaign about the socio-economic benefits of organic farming technology, farmers have started to shift from chemical to organic methods.

Since the community is resource-poor, most families work in agricultural production and animal husbandry during the week while their children attend school. On Sundays, almost all of the members of the community travel to a nearby city in order to sell chickens, guinea pigs, cows and a variety of vegetables. This cyclical process leaves little room for young women and girls to pursue other activities like learning a new skill or trade. Nonetheless, they are involved in a variety of civic associations such as the mother's club, communal cooking, and milk distribution.  
<BR><BR>
In a recent meeting of the mother's club, the community health promoters held a brainstorming session about economic activities the mothers could pursue instead of working in agriculture and animal husbandry. The majority selected learning how to sew clothing since it is more proficient and profitable. Broadly, a tailoring workshop will provide a new skill set and an opportunity for the young women and girls to become economically independent. 
<BR><BR>
A community partner supervises a sewing company in another city, but from time to time he visits his family here. He is interested in selling his local sewing and seaming machines as well as providing the required training and feedback for the women and young girls to successfully apply these resources. Additionally, he intends to sell the other necessary materials to them at a discounted rate. 
<BR><BR>
After various coordination meetings between this community partner, the community health promoters, and the young women and girls, the project will take approximately two months from start to finish, including: the training of ten young women and girls, the practicing of their new skills, and the selling of their products in the marketplace three times with a period allotted for the reflection and evaluation after each experience. Additionally, the young women and girls will be trained in accounting skills by a local community member in order to keep track of their work.",KY,609.29,55,500,0,14-OCT-2014,Gender and Development,Business Training,2015-03-25T00:00:00

A major problem at this school is that many teachers are living off of the school grounds and commute up to twenty kilometers every day to teach. Due to travel stresses, some teachers are tired and unmotivated to teach upon arriving at the school. Primary construction on the unfinished houses is already complete; the walls, roof, and windows are completed and the septic tanks have been installed. However, the floors still need to be concreted, the walls need molding, ceiling boards, and doors need to be installed, and everything needs to be painted. Additionally, a bed, table, and two chairs will be built to put in each house to make it fully habitable. This labor will be provided by skilled laborers as well as unskilled laborers, working under the skilled laborers' supervision. The school had identified the completion of teacher housing as a primary objective. However, construction remains incomplete due to a lack of resources. A school constructions committee, composed of school staff members, have repeatedly requested for additional funding from the district, but not enough resources are currently available. This project would provide funding to complete the unfinished teachers' housing. When this project is implemented, costs estimates of the total project cost will be 6,540,000 Tanzanian shillings. Of this amount, the local community will contribute 2,162,000 Tanzanian shillings. This includes cash contributions and contracted labor, although a lot of the labor will be voluntary. Sustainability of this project will include regular upkeep of the completed houses by the school staff and community via routine inspection. The effects of the completed housing will be evaluated and monitered by the school staff and the community as teachers move to the community and continue to work at the school. This project will be overseen by the school construction committee each step of the way. After construction is complete, the committee will oversee routine inspection and maintenence to ensure the grounds are in good shape. This project will build the capacity of all community members involved, and it will have a beneficial result to the community and its members for many years to come.",TX,1326.38,33,2676.69,0,,Municipal Development,Housing,2015-03-25T00:00:00

There is no clinic, secondary school, access to electricity, or adequate transportation. There is however, a primary school in which the village takes great pride. One of the major challenges currently facing the school is a lack of teachers, particularly teachers who stay in the village for an extended period of time and are committed to their job as educators. In the past, the primary school has seen high teacher turn over and the village views a lack of adequate teacher housing as a major contributing factor to this occurrence. Recognizing this problem, funds were raised within the village and they attempted to build additional teachers housing. The village was able to construct the foundation, walls, and roof of a house. However, due to an ultimate lack of funding, construction was halted. <br>
Throughout VSA activities the volunteer found the construction of additional teacher housing to be a top priority throughout the village. The village has pledged to contribute 31% of the total budget of 5,961,000 Tsh in addition to the costs that have already been contributed to build the existing structure. The community also established a committee consisting of five well-respected individuals that would help oversee and manage the project. The committee consists of the primary school headmaster, the village chairperson, a general contractor, two local craftsmen who have assisted on large construction projects in the past, and a treasurer.
The village realizes the importance of committed teachers who choose to remain and teach in the village for their careers. By completing additional teacher housing it not only helps the teachers and their family, it also helps every student at the school by reducing teacher turnover and increases the amount of time that teachers can spend at school. It is hoped that by improving the quality of teaching, test scores will improve and more students will qualify to attend secondary school. This project will also be an income generating activity for local laborers who work on the project and a source of pride for the village knowing that they started a project themselves and persevered until it was finished. Construction will start in late May once rainy season has subsided and will be completed within a 90 day time period. One house will be completed that consists of five rooms and a back building that contains a cooking room, storage area, shower area, and latrine.

It is because of these challenges that students often find it a necessity to take their learning into their own hands. Every free moment the students have, they spend reading the notes they took in their classes trying to memorize enough information to pass their national exams.
<BR><BR>
This system is simply not providing students with the education they need to be successful citizens. One solution to these problems is to provide schools with textbooks to begin creating a resource library, where students and teachers can go to access accurate information. The problem begins with the fact that government funding for textbooks is simply too low to purchase enough books to have a substantial library. The government funding could, however, assist schools to maintain a library and purchase books on a needs basis once the groundwork has been set.
<BR><BR>
The Community Day Secondary Schools involved in this project will contribute 250 Malawi Kwacha for each student at their school towards the purchase of books. The project contribution will be an additional 750 MK per student to go towards the purchase of books. The Peace Corps Volunteer will work with each school on the care and management of books and how to run a school library. The Volunteer will also assist head teachers to set up an account to manage 250 MK per student per year to purchase books on a needs basis in the future. By assisting these secondary schools, we will reduce the student to book ratio which now stands at around 15:1 in more fortunate schools and even up to 100:1 in some cluster schools.

The school directors have been very supportive of MSS and the Leadership Camp. As was the case last year, we plan to implicate local female professionals and our community work partners of both sexes in programming for the camp. The camp will again be held at the a local community educational center where we have a good working relationship with the director.

This project is requesting assistance in funding three hand-augured rope pump well systems for three small, isolated villages.  The members of these communities are Malian fishermen, who currently obtain their drinking water one jug at a time on the back of bicycles from villages 2-3 Km away because it is unsafe for the women to carry water that distance through the bush.  Any additional water (for washing dishes and laundry or bathing) comes from nearby swamps and the river.  This weakens their health, wastes their time, and strains relationships between them and the villages where they fetch water.
<BR><BR>
A clean water source would allow these communities to be more independent.  The women would no longer need to depend on the men to bring them the water they need to cook and drink, and the men would have more time to devote to their fishing.  Water-borne illness would decrease.  Additionally, having a water source in each village would cut down on congestion at the already busy pumps in the larger villages and relax tensions from resulting from such.
<BR><BR>
Three communities are interested in partnering with Peace Corps Partnership and the NGO concern Universal to install rope-pump well systems in each of their villages.  Concern Universal will provide training on digging and maintaining the systems.  Each village is willing to contribute labor, the cost of some materials and transport, and food and lodging for the Concern Universal staff.  They are requesting assistance from the Peace Corp Partnership for the components of the well system and surveying and equipment mobilization fees.

Approximately 90% of all these deaths are due to unsafe water and poor hygiene. Madagascar is one of the poorest countries in the world and only half of the population has access to safe drinking water. The water consumed by the population is drawn from rivers and creeks located several kilometers away from their homes without using proper cleaning methods. The Merina people of the Vakinankaratra Region of Madagascar want and need latrines and wells; they, however, do not have enough money to purchase the materials, with an average daily income of less than $1. With help from family and friends in the United States, we plan on building 18 latrines and 18 wells in 7 different communities spread across 20 kilometers.   This Total Sanitation project has four components: to instill behavior change methods in the local community, to provide access to durable latrines in the most rural areas, to provide access to water sources in the most rural areas, and to educate the local community on safe drinking water and safe disposal of feces to reduce illnesses and improve sanitation.

Right now there are no public reading institutions in the surrounding municipalities of the community and there are very few books in schools and homes because they are so expensive.  Students often come to my house looking for books in order to finish school projects.  The library will provide the students with a source of knowledge from inside the community.  Another one of the goals would be to help the teachers gather and share information.  Then the teachers will be better able to contribute to the education of the Paraguayan youth.  With a library in the community the students and the teachers will receive a new level of literacy and appreciation for their country, their culture and the world.

Glenn","The problem of trash accumulation and poor trash management is one that countries throughout the world face; however, in the third world it is one that is extremely evident and has dire community health consequences.  To counter this, two Environmental Education PCVs assigned to the village of Nguith decided that their adoptive 'home' would be ideal to test a system of sustainable, low level trash management and raise community awareness.
<BR><BR>
This trash management project is important to the villagers of Nguith due to the abundance of trash located on the village periphery and found throughout the village. The elementary school is located at the edge of a trash dumping location; hence the school grounds often are littered with hazardous refuse.  Many village children are too poor to afford shoes and are forced to play in or traverse areas covered with dangerous objects. 
<BR><BR>
Implementing a trash management system will enable trash to be collected daily, sorted and then disposed of in the most appropriate manner (composting, recycling, incineration, or burial). A collection system would replace villagers tendency to simply dump their refuse by a system of collection containers placed throughout the village that enable refuse to be picked up daily, taken to management locations (varied according to wind direction to prevent excessive air pollution in village), sorted, and then disposed. To ensure sustainability, every household will contribute 30 cfa per day (0.05 cents) to cover wages for two teams and provide for a fund to allow future repair/replacement costs.

There are children who want books in the community to learn how to read, youth who do not want to do their homework in their noisy house in-between house chores, and those who attend the university who want to learn how to use computers to do their homework.  The closest library is a 30 minute walk and has irregular hours.  The members of the community give up on their education because it takes time and money to travel to another community, pay to use resources to do their homework; therefore getting a degree takes years to earn and is seen as impossible.  A library with books in the community would let them have a better chance of getting further in school and being able to find better jobs with a degree.  The community found the location for the library and thought it would be most utilized if it was in a central location in the community.  Next, it was asking what needed to be done in order to have ownership of the land and it was given to me free of charge without having to write a letter.  The location set, I wrote a list of materials with a construction worker and we went to the hardware store to write up the cost.",MO,1778.03,26,5131.85,0,,Municipal Development,Library,2015-03-25T00:00:00

Today, 200 students are being taught nursery, primary, and junior high classes by 8 faculty members, in 8 classrooms. As the number of students continues to grow, the school will need more space and security.  The purpose of this project is to build two additional classrooms and a wall around the complex. The mission of the school is simple: to give hope to the hopeless.  Before attending the school, these children were receiving no form of schooling - many were set to be trafficked away to fishing villages. Others had just returned, having escaped from their trafficking. No matter their background story, the vast majority of these students just simply did not have the means or support necessary to attend school.  By building two additional classrooms and a wall surrounding the complex, members of the community hope to help increase access to education for more children and ensure their safety and security in their new school environment.",IL,906.38,33,1880.85,0,,Municipal Development,School/Class Construction,2015-03-25T00:00:00

This project empowers high school students in the Comarca Ngäbe Buglé (CNB), an indigenous region of Panama where extreme poverty rates are over 80% in many communities. The second phase of the UAC project is a continued effort to deeply invest in a select group of Ngäbe students with desire and potential to successfully attend an institute of higher learning. The concept of UAC is that once a student enters into the program, there is continued follow-up, capacity building, and general support to drive that student to articulate his/her educational goals, to form an action plan, to stay on track with the plan, to attend professional development/computer training workshops, to connect with existing resources in the country, to attend a specific school of agriculture and animal husbandry, and to graduate. Not only does phase two of UAC support a new group of 22 exemplary high school students, but it also provides support to students who have continued with the program from phase one (7 students) and 25 other interested sixth-year students in a general university orientation. This project is dedicated to long-term, sustainable, community empowerment.

While it services the rest of the university, it offers seven (7) baccalaureate specializations, viz.: AB Language & Literature Teaching, AB in Political Science, Sociology, Broadcast Communication, BS in Community Development, BS in Development Communication, and BS in Criminology within its system.  These are anchored on its mission to offer liberal education in the humanities and communication for the development of the students into well-rounded persons who are prepared to face life and lead with professional competence and dignity in the service of humankind.
<BR><BR>
The College is with 100 highly competitive and committed faculty members and has an enrollment of a little less than 2,000 spread through the seven course offerings. The learning resources that the university currently has are stowed in the University Library and are largely limited to nursing and science text books, which have no relevance to the CAC community. In turn the learning resources that CAC currently has are limited to one locked up bookcase that holds a small (less than 100) out-dated literature related resources.
<BR><BR>
With the rising standards in education and tight competition for employment, the need to extend learning assistance to students and ensure productivity is a matter of urgency.  This means acquisition of significantly relevant curricular reading materials (text books, references, etc) for the seven curricular offerings.
Concretely, the present project has been conceptualized to be able to extend assistance to the students of the College of Arts & Communication.  The establishment of a Resource Center will provide an avenue for both students and faculty members to converge for learning assistance.
<BR><BR>
The project envisions a Center which will make available resources and create opportunities for the development and enhancement of independent learning skills such as critical thinking, decision making, appropriate use of materials and information and instill reading appreciation to as far as doing research work among students. These skills will help arrest the slow but steady deterioration of students’ scholastic performance and ensure competence in the outside world.
<BR><BR>
Simultaneous with the establishment of the Resource Center is the conduct of a learning assistance program (LAP) and peer tutoring.  These activities will involve all members of the CAC community including, student leaders and faculty members. The center will eventually be the home to these programs, for meetings and study sessions.

685-199,SENEGAL,2012-04-12T11:31:30,"Urban Reforestation Initiative","MI Grabowski J.","Desertification is an ongoing challenge in Northern Senegal. One driving factor of this process is deforestation. Communities cut down trees for cooking fuel and fail to replant new trees for two reasons. First, because young trees are quickly eaten by animals or are trampled by cars, feet or hooves. Secondly, because community members do not understand the importance of planting and caring for trees. These two factors, apathy and lack of proper care, prevent the success of reforestation projects. A successful approach will provide the means to adequately protect trees from cows, horses, and unsupervised children, while simultaneously working to change attitudes towards the planting and care of trees.
<BR><BR>
The goal of this project is to plant trees, provide them protective structures, and train communities in the importance of proper tree care. The primary expense will be the tree protections. Because every family owns goats, sheep, or cows in the targeted communities, and because these animals are allowed to roam freely, protections must be strong. A benefit of having strong protections is reusability: with 100 tree cages, many hundreds of trees will be able to be safely planted by moving the cages after trees grow large enough to no longer require protection. 
<BR><BR>
As trees are able to successfully grow throughout the targeted communities, attitudes towards them will slowly change. Houses without trees will become shady and cooler, while others will have fruit trees that will provide food and income. Seeing first-hand the value of trees and the ease with which they can be grown when properly cared for will begin to change attitudes towards reforestation. It will be this attitude shift which will ultimately contribute significantly to fighting desertification in Northern Senegal.

Currently, there are few textbooks available within the school and even fewer story books, which are so crucial for encouraging a love of reading in the youngest learners.

The main aims of the Village Wordplay project are to encourage spelling and learning both English and Kiswahili with hands-on style materials for children ages 3 through secondary school. The hands-on materials used to accomplish is goal are alphabet blocks for children 3 through primary school(Kiswahili alphabet and ratios) and bananagram tiles (in English) for students in secondary schools and a set of each will be made of every member of the 2013 Education class and distributed in small, locally made drawstring bags.  
The project will positively affect the lives of the children and students by increasing their ability to spell, therefore increasing their chances at passing the NECTA. Only by passing the NECTA can students follow through with higher education and become successful in reaching their educational goals.  The Peace Corps Volunteer is working directly with seamstresses, carpenters and teachers in her village who are supporting and contributing to the project’s success acting as the project’s committee. 
The committee is made up of 2 village funds ( a carpenter and a seamstress), 2 secondary school language teachers, and one primary school teacher. On June 6th, the carpenters and seamstresses will be instructed on how to create the distribution bags and the dimensions on how to cut the blocks and tiles from wood. Once the wooden materials are cut, groups of students from a local secondary school will help to sand them and then varnish them after they are painted. They will also help to place the completed sets into bags. Community contribution for this project comes from the seamstress and carpenters, who will be donating half of their products, as well as student time to help sand, varnish and put together the final product for distribution to interested volunteers at our mid-service conference to be held in August. This project will be implemented from May 2014 to August 2014. 
The impact of this project will be as great as the amount of volunteers who agree to take and use the blocks. In theory, 40 volunteers will receive blocks. If each volunteer works with even just 10 primary children and 10 secondary school students using the learning aids, 800 students will benefit from this project in villages across Tanzania. 
All volunteers of the Education 2013 class will be emailed and must state their interest in receiving the blocks and thusly agree to report the progress of the students using them. The sustainability of this project is multitier. Not only will the knowledge and skills gained by the students be sustainable in themselves, but this is a possible income-generating project down the road for the fundi’s involved. Also, volunteers who receive the sets and would like more themselves or for members of their community are encouraged to help teach their own local village fundis , painters and seamstresses the skills to replicate the blocks and create more. The replication of blocks and tiles would also increase the number of child beneficiaries of the project.   The total budget for this project comes to 1,337,000 Tsh of which 339,000 Tsh will be provided by the community (25.35%).

These out-of-school youth then have few options other than following in their parents' footsteps, which means subsistence farming for boys, and marriage and babies for girls.

To combat the social and economic problem posed by this growing wave of out-of-school, unskilled, and unemployed youth, the community is creating a vocational school to provide young people with real-world skills and continuing education. Students, both boys and girls, will be matched with skilled local tradesmen and women to receive vocational instruction, language and accounting courses, and workshops on topics including HIV/AIDS, goal-setting, and family planning. The
program will provide these young people with the skills and knowledge needed to start their own businesses and create healthy futures. This growing population of more educated and skilled entrepreneurs will contribute to the entire community's economic and social development, reducing unemployment and poverty.

Peace Corps Partnership funds will act as microloans for the concerned entrepreneurs to purchase the capital necessary for tailoring, mechanics, wood-working, welding, and construction training. Since the tradesmen and women will benefit from extra labor, increasing the profits of their individual businesses, they will gradually reimburse the value of the equipment purchased with PCPP funds; hence, startup funds from PCPP will be paid back to the school, doubling its resources.

The system will capture rainwater and well water, allowing students to stay in the classroom and fetch water after class, and will create a reserve of clean water for the dry seasons. By increasing the availability of potable water and decreasing labor required to fetch water, dormitory girls' health and academic performance will improve. The school community hopes to implement this project between June and September 2014.  The total cost of installing two 8,000 L SIM tanks attached to rain gutters and a water pump is 7,064,000 Tanzanian Shillings (TSH). The school will contribute 550,000 TSH in cash and 1,215,000 TSH is construction materials, manual labor, and transportation costs. A water committee comprised of nine staff members, led by the headmistress, is responsible for budgeting, implementing, and evaluating this project. The committee chose water catchment and plastic SIM tanks because of the system's durability and relative simplicity to repair. Nevertheless, the committee has reserved 400,000 TSH for future maintenance costs the system might need. After the system is built, the committee will continue to meet every semester to ensure water resources are being effectively and sustainably utilized by the school community.

This leaves community members to walk several kilometers to the nearest water pump, costing more time and money, or more often, going to the local stream for water. This is not only inconvenient, but also causes a large number of water-borne illnesses. The number of typhoid cases at the local health center from January 2014-November 2014 was 194. The number of intestinal parasites was 124. The hospital services approximately 4,000 residents. These statistics include only the cases that  tested positive at the local health center.

The population contacted me for a possible water project because their children were drinking from the river and getting sick. Soon after, I contacted a technician who came down to look at the site and then we put a plan in action together in order to realize the project. We realize that money will be a problem but that has encouraged the members of the community to find a solution. For their 25% contribution, they are contributing materials and labor. They are really trying and we have discussed with the technician many times about their financial difficulties and he has reduced his asking price and is willing to take on their labor to further reduce the price. Everyone is trying to make this happen because it has been a long-time coming. 
<BR><BR>
Overall, the water project has three components, but the grant will be used for the water pump. The rest will be funded by the population of the village. The first step of the project is the construction of a water pump for the community. We have chosen the only location of a primary school for the water pump because it is a central location for the children and the members of the community to access. 
<BR><BR>
Second, after this project is launched off the ground, I hope to do a series of Water and Sanitation and Hygiene (WASH) activities with the children at the school in order to improve hygienic behavior and behavioral change.  I have already trained my peer educators on WASH activities and they have already trained the teachers and parents of 9 primary schools in my village and in the surrounding bush villages before this past school year ended. We hope this training will have an effect on the children at school and in the home. We will reinforce the WASH activities this upcoming school year and will be able to evaluate the effects of the training of the parents and the teachers on the students during the summer vacation. The community has also raised money so that we can do a larger-scale tippy-tap hand washing station project. With this, we will teach potable water treatment methods and effective hand washing techniques. 
<BR><BR>
Third, I will be doing a Moringa tree project. We will be making beds near the water pump so that water that leaves the pump in the gutter will not go to waste and can be directed towards the trees. It is our way of diminishing the environmental effects of the pump.
<BR><BR>
The community will contribute their 25% in labor and materials.  Each week leading up to the construction of the pump, the children will collect the gravel and sand needed to complete the project by the riverbed. During the construction, the adults will be helping with the labor instead of hiring extra hands. This has reduced the total sum for the pump drastically. 
<BR><BR>
This project has much potential because this will be the first of its kind in the village. At the moment, there are no clean sources of water. The children and the adults in the community are currently drinking from the river where they wash their clothes and bathe, among other things. Therein, I am hoping to reduce the number of cases of typhoid in the village.  There is no hospital in the village because it is in the bush and therefore, they have to go to the nearest village 30 minutes away to be treated.

In its current state, the public catchment tank lacks a cover, leaving water exposed to a wide array of contaminants, including animal feces, dirt and contamination from frogs and insects living directly in the water. The community plans to construct a catchment tank cover which, combined with proper meshing over both inlet and outlet pipes, will prevent most contaminants from entering the drinking water supply. Prior to this stage of the project, the community plans to thoroughly clean and white-wash the inside of the tank and clear off surrounding brush that has been encroaching on the neglected tank,
Additionally, the community plans to construct another smaller tank at the bottom of the existing one that will serve as the chlorination chamber for the drinking water to further ensure elimination of microscopic contaminants. The construction will take place at the end of the dry season when the tank is already dry so as not to cause any construction-related water outages.

However, it is possible to grow these cash crops only during the raining season and currently there is no dry season gardening on a village wide scale.  This, alone with limited access to weekly markets, has led to a nutrient poor diet low in fresh fruits and vegetables and limited to grains and dried fish.  This unvaried diet has exacerbated many health and developmental problems, primarily in children.  Promoting vegetable gardening in the village through the Women’s Group is a tangible way to turn around this problem and will lead to many health benefits for the people of Ngekhokh.  Moreover, growing vegetables for sale may also provide an additional income source to supplement crop production.

The project’s scope will include the establishment of a minimum of two gardening sites providing adequate space for lessons in environmental education ranging from nutrition, plant life cycles, and reforestation.  The women’s group is highly motivated and has attempted year-round gardening in the past.  However, its limited success has been due to inadequate facilities and supplies which this grant proposal attempts to remedy.  The group owns two gardening plots: one surrounded by metal0post/barbed wire and live fences and containing a well and the other located at the primary school lacking both well and fencing.  Until the present time, however, attempts at gardening livestock to enter and graze on tender vegetables.  Additionally, high water salinity in the well has led to problems with vegetable germination and growth.  From experience with other village wells, the women are confident that a new well of 8-10 meters in depth in a new location, instead of the current well at 12 meters will remedy this problem.  The women’s group requests funds to fortify the fencing with new barbed wire, fence the school garden plot and to construct new wells.  They are contributing 1000 CFA each toward this project, the total of which will be put into a bank account at the Credit Mutel in Djilor by the president of the Women’s Group.  This money will be used to purchase seeds, supplies, and make future repairs to the women’s group garden.

With this year's 4th annual event, WWEC will introduce the new brand name ""Illumination: Lighting the path for a nation of women.""
<BR><BR> 
Togo is home to many dynamic, strong and motivated women, but all too often they are overlooked as a source of vital community development. Illumination 2014 will bring 30 of these women together and provide them with an empowering, professional platform to learn how to become advocates for women's rights and women's health in their communities. Throughout the conference each woman will have the opportunity to share her personal experiences and grow from those of her peers, creating a strong network of female agents of change. In order to further enourage the women to take action for community change, we encourage women to apply for the conference in pairs so each can have the positive reinforcement of another WWEC participant on the local level.
<BR><BR>
From past experience, WWEC finds that the greatest change comes when participants have continued support and encouragement easily accessible following the conference. To achieve this we will host reconnect events on the regional level three months following the national conference. These events will allow WWEC to continue offering technical and social support through the creation of a close-knit regional network. The women will share their challenges and success stories regarding the work they did following the conference and will identify regional resources and work opportunities available to them. To demonstrate interest and commitment to this project, selected participants will pay a registration fee of 3000cfa and/or donate materials such as food supplies or services (i.e. midwife consultations, batik printing, etc.). Upon returning to their villages, each participant will also hold trainings on at least two topics covered during the conference. WWEC Illumination 2014 will forge strong female leaders across Togo who will tackle the difficulties facing the nation's women with regards to their health and rights and light the path for a better future.",IN,2084.00,25,6165.8,209.38,,Gender and Development,Conference,2015-03-25T00:00:00

The workstation-based lab is a cost effective and newly emerging approach to computer education that is easy to maintain (no viruses), easily expandable and contains no illegally pirated software!
<BR><BR>
This lab will be unlike anything else the college has attempted for several reasons: first it will make use of workstations instead of desktop systems.  This means that there is one high power CPU that powers 10 fully functional workstations.  The server will be configured with this setup, thereby setting up all workstations simultaneously.  Additionally, the students’ inability to add files to the workstation using a USB drive limits the spread of viruses.
<BR><BR>
A large part of the cost saving is done by foregoing expensive Microsoft Windows licenses and using a single server to freely and legally share the installation. Further savings will be from the low power workstation, which will only run a monitor, keyboard, and mouse.  The CPU is located in the server, which is equivalent to a powerful desktop computer.
<BR><BR>
Finally, due to the school’s limited budget, the ability to create or expand a standard computer lab is prohibitively expensive. This lab’s small form factor lends itself to lower energy consumption, as the computers do not produce much heat and a great deal of money is saved on air conditioning.
<BR><BR>
This lab will serve as a model beginning for the College of Education computer lab.  In the future the school will be able to easily expand and continue this server/workstation style of computer lab.

In what will hopefully become an annual event in PC/Guinea, we are using World Book Day to promote reading in as many communities as possible by giving out thousands of mini-books. We aim to support and reinforce a culture of reading by adding to the available reading material and by endorsing reading as a fun and rewarding activity. Mini-books are books that can be produced very cheaply by photocopying stories and information in the public domain. Volunteers in 92 communities, including 56 schools, with the help of teachers, principals, and counterparts will distribute 20,000 mini-books to individuals ranging from primary school students to adults.

Throughout Guinea, there is undeniably a lack of books. Mini-books enable us to put books into kids' hands, and the World Book Day event is an opportunity to actively engage with the stories, connecting the written word to entertainment and excitement. For many students, this will be the first book they will ever call their own. Teachers, too, will enjoy the rare opportunity to spend time reading with their students rather than supervising as they copy from the blackboard. This project is possible due to the generous reduction in printing cost by a local printer and through the active support and organization by community partners and schools.

Firstly, I want to get running water to my health structure. This includes running water in the maternity ward, first aid room, and bathrooms. The objective is to increase the access to clean water and improve the sanitation of my health hut. Next, I want to create a 9m x 20m garden around the side of my health hut full of vegetables and moringa. The objective is to increase the community's knowledge of what is good nutrition and a diverse diet. We will also give malnutrition talks centered around the demo garden. I would also like to plant an ornamental garden around the health structure along with the entrance to create a calming, welcoming environment. Next, I intend to provide a fresh paint job to the exterior and interior of the health hut to create a professional appearance. I would also use paint to design murals on the exterior of the health structure, as visual learning tools to teach important health practices. This will provide a platform to teach mothers about the importance of exclusive breastfeeding and the importance of sleeping under a bed net to combat malaria, among other health topics. In the necessity of providing electricity, I wish to install a solar panel to provide a safer working environment for nighttime health emergencies. Lastly, I wish to provide essential materials for the health hut such as another mattress for the maternity ward, soap, towels, a blood pressure machine, and a scale to weigh newborns. The community will contribute to helping dig the trenches for the robinet, creation and upkeep of the garden, upkeep of the bathrooms, as well as a financial contribution.

Write On! was created by a Peace Corps Georgia volunteer in 2003 and aimed to spark the imaginations of Georgian students. It was an immediate success and its simple design and effective process has led to its nearly doubling in size in the last year alone. While the participants in the competition only have one hour to craft their response to the official prompt they are provided, their participation in the competition begins long beforehand. Write On! prepares students, teachers, and professionals for the competition by providing lesson plans to volunteers and their counterparts that teach creative writing strategies and techniques. These lesson plans then become useful tools for counterparts worldwide to continue using creative writing as a method to engage and motivate their students.  This year, Write On!

The Library Committee is comprised of volunteer members of the community, the chief, local secondary school teachers, and student leaders from each Form A, B, and C. The committee, in particular, wants to emphasize that this building will be used for a variety of activities, not just study. Also, it was discussed in the committee, the often negative connotation that the term library unearths among community members; hence, the title, ""resource center"", was proposed. This project aims to target three major audiences within the village: students, teachers, and community members. For each target audience, we have specific, testable goals in order to ensure the success of this project within our community. The objective of this project within the school is to enhance 'student-centered' teaching practices through resource texts and increase the use of books within the classroom for outside study. Also, the facility will be used by students as a space for study, discussion and extra-curricular activities. The community hopes to use the library to further independent study and create community-based workshops on a variety of topics, especially agriculture. Within these target audiences, we have developed individual leaders who serve on the library committee within our village, which is responsible for creating goals, guidelines, and promoting project support within our community. Through the library committee, we have set a goal of raising 25% of the required funds to complete the project and are recruiting volunteers to assist with construction and organization of the center upon the arrival of books. The school has previously applied through a non-profit for books for the center, which are expected to arrive in June. In order to ensure this projects success, Library Committee members are going to organize workshops for students, teachers, and community members on the use and practices within the library. The library committee will be the leaders in educating other village members on the library and stimulating initial workshops.

One is to produce a regular source of animal protein to combat food insecurity for impoverished families. Over 128 kgs of animal protein will be produced every four months and will benefit vulnerable children suffering from disease, malnutrition, and stunting. A second objective is educating the 28 members of the Young Farmers Club through classroom and practical experience in agribusiness skills - otherwise unavailable at such a young age - to better equip them with basic business and leadership skills for a future livelihood. These youth will also be trained in peer education so that others may benefit from their experience. The third objective is reduction of land pressure in a rapidly urbanizing area by introducing over 400 community members to small livestock value chain opportunities. The establishment of a centrally located small livestock demonstration site will provide continuous education on rabbit farming practices, new market opportunities, and value addition products. The project will also strengthen community partnerships and relationships with local institutions, including the local university, other NGOs, CBOs, and farmers. The identified community contribution includes: land for the project, labor to manage the project, continual oversight and implementation by organizational members, education in small livestock opportunities, and long-term maintenance and repair of all project aspects.
