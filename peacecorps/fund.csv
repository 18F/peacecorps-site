In doing so, 5,568 children associated with these schools and organizations will have access to books within a year, thereby enhancing their learning environments and creating a culture of literacy. Within 10 years, approximately 15,000 children will benefit from the new or enhanced libraries in their community.

Currently there are 300 hundred students enrolled in sixth and seventh grade with 3 teachers, principal and vice principal.  Next year there will be an eighth grade and the following year a ninth grade.  At this point, the middle school will be fully functioning.

The proposed library resource center will provide 3 computers, solar powered electricity for 2 classrooms and a printer.  This project's main objectives are to provide computer and technology educations for students, computer and technology training for teachers, general administrative needs for students and staff as well as provide a location for after school studying.  In today's society, computer training is an invaluable tool and the Burkina Faso education system currently provides no services in regards to technology particularly on the village level.

Extensive damage occurred to housing, schools and infrastructure.  One of the local high schools in a coastal barangay experienced extensive damage.  Most of their educational equipment and supplies were completely destroyed including a tower that provided internet access and all of its 20 computers.  Since then, students, under the supervision of teachers and PTA members with information technology expertise, have managed to repair 7 computers.  The internet tower and the other 13 computers were beyond repair.    
<BR><BR>
As the internet and computers were widely used in the high school's curriculum prior to Yolanda by both students and teachers, they have attempted, without success to date, to find possible donors for replacement of the totally damaged internet tower and computers.  As such, the high school's curriculum has suffered.  
<BR><BR>
The proposed project seeks to restore internet access to the high school by replacement of the internet tower and associated connection cables.  Also, the high school seeks to partially replace the computers and day light projector that were lost due to Super Typhoon Yolanda.

The NPRC is a vehicle for Volunteers to meet Peace Corps goals and for Armenians to become motivated to improve their understanding of English, practice their critical thinking skills, and become active in the arts. Typically, there is little room for creativity in the English-language curriculum, so the NPRC may prove a unique experience for Armenian students, introducing them to some of the best-loved poems in Anglophone poetry, as well as current works dealing with topical issues of our time.

Through students' enthusiasm and determination to make it to the NPRC, their families, peers, and communities are exposed to the challenges and excitement of hard work coming full circle. The competition consists of three stages that allow participants to exhibit their knowledge of the English language through the meaningful recitation of poetry. First students work with local Peace Corps Volunteers and teachers to understand, memorize, and develop their presentation of a chosen work. Next, regional competitions are held, and first-place winners are then invited to compete in the final stage at the national level in the capital city.

Four of these classrooms are incomplete; they do not have floors, walls, doors, or windows. The lack of enough classrooms, as well as the state of the four current classrooms, is not only detrimental to the students' learning environment, but also to the students' and teachers' safety.  Recently, the roofs of the classrooms have begun to cave in, and the only solution that the community can afford is to create support structures out of wooden pillars. This problem concerns the safety of the students and faculty who must use these classrooms on a daily basis due to the lack of enough classrooms. Another problem, posed by the student to classroom ratio, is the faculty must schedule classes during the period allotted for extracurricular activities. This prevents students from participating in extracurricular activities which inhibits their academic success. As well, faculty must also hold classes from 5 pm to 7 pm most nights. The classrooms at the school do not have lights, so once the sun sets at 6:30 pm the teachers must release their classes shortening their time to teach their lessons and materials needed for the students' yearly exams.	
<BR><BR>
The school administration along with the community has taken an active role in improving their students' learning environment by building latrines and a library in recent years, but it is struggling to find the means to finish the necessary improvements to their classrooms or building additional classrooms that are very much needed. This community has been actively engaged in this project, and will contribute over half the cost of this project through cash and in-kind contributions.
<BR><BR>
Finishing these four classrooms and building an additional two classrooms will create a positive and secure learning environment for the students, as well as empower the teachers to better aid their students in their educational journey. 
<BR><BR>
The community and school administration are ready and eager to promote a brighter future for the children in this rural community, but they cannot do this without your help.

<br><br>
Peace Corps is returning to Sierra Leone after a period of extended civil war.  Soon after the civil war ended, the Government of Sierra Leone (GoSL) identified education as a national priority. Sierra Leone¿s educational system has been transitioning from post-conflict resolution to sustainable development and working to provide quality and affordable education.  In response to this national priority, the Peace Corps¿ initial return to Sierra Leone will focus on Secondary Education Volunteers teaching English, science, and math. 
<br><br>
In addressing prevalent needs in Sierra Leone, Peace Corps volunteers work hand in hand with their Sierra Leonean community and school counterparts in engaging the community to identify their priority needs and possible interventions. The community also identifies local resources and gaps within which external assistance is required.  Donations to the Country Fund will be utilized to help fill those gaps and provide additional resources.
<br><br>
The theme of future programming in Sierra Leone is strong and strategic growth. In 2012, a second project area may be added to complement the existing Secondary Education Project and Peace Corps will more than double the number of Volunteers in country. Future programming expansion will likely focus on community development, health education, agriculture, and food security, in keeping with GoSL priorities. Strengthening local organizational capacities, food security, and income generation are explicitly advocated as major goals of many national development initiatives.

To achieve this we will host reconnect events on the regional level three months following the national conference. These events will allow WWEC to continue offering technical and social support through the creation of a close-knit regional network.
