    description: Through the generous support of donors across America, each
      year the Peace Corps Partnership Program funds hundreds of
      community-initiated projects all over the globe. If you are interested
      in helping Peace Corps Volunteers and communities accomplish amazing
      projects, but do not have a specific project in mind, you can contribute
      to the Global Fund. Donations to the Global Fund go towards a wide
      variety of Partnership Program projects that find that they are falling
      short of funding from other sources. Should a project or special fund
      receive full support from other sources or be canceled, any remaining
      funds will automatically be directed to the Global Fund and be used for
      Volunteer and community projects.

      support program for malaria prevention activities across sub-Saharan
      Africa. Contributions to the Fund support community identified,
      volunteer facilitated malaria prevention Peace Corps Partnership Program
      projects such as training community health workers in malaria diagnosis
      and treatment, creating small businesses selling mosquito repellent
      cr√®mes, delivering insecticide treated nets, providing education to
      thousands of community members on how to protect oneself from malaria
      and many more. According to WHO statistics, Malaria kills 750,000 people
      annually and while large scale international efforts have seen notable
      success in the last decade, malaria is still the scourge of much of
      Africa. Contributions to the Fund allow volunteers and their communities
      to pilot the next round of innovative best practices which will inform
      malaria prevention world-wide.
