      the Fund for their previous PCPP projects are also welcome to contribute
      to ensure Kate's continuing legacy.

    description: "Contributions to this Fund are committed to
      community-initiated and Volunteer-led projects such as establishing
      women's cooperatives, increasing women's access to resources and
      services, exploring gender roles, building shelters, and increasing
      training programs. The Loret Miller Ruppe and Loret, Jr. Fund for the
      Advancement of Women was established to celebrate the lives of Loret
      Miller Ruppe who was the longest serving Director in Peace Corps history
      and Loret Jr., her daughter. Loret Miller Ruppe served as Director from
      1981-89 and was a great, vocal advocate for the Peace Corps' mission of
      world peace and friendship both globally and domestically. Her passion
      for service inspired her daughter, Loret, Jr., to serve as a Peace Corps
      Volunteer in Nepal. Their vision and hard work brought hope to
      communities around the world, especially for women.<p />
      To honor the outstanding contributions of Loret Miller Ruppe, this fund
      was established with a generous grant from her family to assist Peace
      Corps volunteers who wish to carry on the work that was so important to
      her: the empowerment of women and girls around the world.<p />
      To celebrate the life and service of Loret, Jr., the fund now highlights
      projects supporting girls' education and camps for girls."
