We tackle challenges that know no borders - such as climate change, pandemic disease, food security, and gender equality and empowerment.

Your gift will help advance the Peace Corps mission and support the work of our Volunteers overseas. Your contribution to the Peace Corps is tax deductible, and is also a way to give in honor or in memory of a loved one."}}]}'

    description: '{"data":[{"type":"text","data":{"text":"Through the generous support of donors across America, each year the Peace Corps Partnership Program funds hundreds of community-initiated projects all over the globe. If you are interested in helping Peace Corps Volunteers and communities accomplish amazing projects, but do not have a specific project in mind, you can contribute to the Global Fund. Donations to the Global Fund go towards a wide variety of Partnership Program projects that find that they are falling short of funding from other sources. Should a project or special fund receive full support from other sources or be canceled, any remaining funds will automatically be directed to the Global Fund and be used for Volunteer and community projects."}}]}'
