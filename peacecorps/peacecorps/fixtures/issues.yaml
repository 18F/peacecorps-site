      in their communities to share the precious gift of education. Often Volunteers'
      dedication to teaching is matched by a severe lack of supplies and facilities
      in which to help. Contributions to this fund will help Volunteer and community
      projects such as school construction, English language training, school and
      library material, and adult literacy.
