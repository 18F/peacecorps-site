    description: Contributions to the Malawi Country Fund will support many varied
      Volunteer projects in Malawi. Malawi is one of the poorest countries in the
      world. Malawi is one of the poorest countries in the world. Apart from poverty,
      Malawi is also heavily hit by HIV/AIDS. Typical projects include water and sanitation,
      agricultural development, Income Generation Activities, youth and HIV/AIDS related
      programs. Many such projects fail to materialise or be implemented better due
      to lack of resources or the time/effort it takes to get them. You can make a
      big difference for both the work of the volunteers and people of Malawi by contributions
      to the Malawi Country Fund, which is designed for faster response to the Volunteers
      and their communities. An example of country fund use was funding a local mini-camp
      for a Volunteer's community, using resources and people that were trained at
      one of the national camps, like Camp GLOW or Camp Sky. These can happen frequently
      as $300 - $800 is above easy Volunteer fund raising, but it goes a long way
      in developing motivation/skills of a local group of 30 young women or youth.

      poor infrastructure, access to clean water especially in rural areas, and adverse
      poverty continues to be Kenya's major challenges. Changes in weather patterns
      and high farming costs have compromised farmers' ability to plant and grow adequate
      food, resulting in shortages of food and hunger in some parts of Kenya. The
      demand for food continues to increase household poverty levels with more than

      these prevalent Kenya community needs, Peace Corps volunteers work hand in hand
      with their Kenyan community counterparts in engaging the community to identify

    description: <p>Students at the agricultural secondary school, spend their days
      accumulating knowledge and practice time with books and a variety of agricultural
      techniques. However, they have very little opportunity to connect with places
      that are not their own or to research beyond their experiences. This project
      aims to transform one of the classrooms into a well-equipped, permanent computer
      lab containing 10 computers with internet access, a photocopy machine, and a
      printer. Students will be able to use this computer lab to receive adequate
      hands-on exposure to practice the material they are learning. Through the improved
      classes, students will be able to hone their skills with common programs such
      as Microsoft Word, Excel, and Power Point, among others. They will also learn
      how to navigate using the internet in order to conduct research, communicate
      with others, and gain a much broader view of the world. The computer lab will
      be operational year-round; open to students after normal classroom hours and
      to the general public during weekends and school breaks. In addition, free or
      low-cost training will be available to students unable to continue their studies
      and peoples of low income. This project will be realized and sustained through
      a partnership between the group STG Informatique and the school administration.
      STG Informatique will help equip the computer lab with necessary accommodations
      such as ceiling fans, networking cables, internet router, etc., and they will
      oversee the functionality of the lab throughout the year. The school administration
      will reserve a portion of its annual budget to provide for the overall maintenance
      and upkeep of the computer lab, and it will create a new, full-time employment
      for a computer lab assistant. In addition to this, profits from computer lab
      services such as photocopies, printed documents, and navigation time will go
      towards the growth of the computer lab, as well as towards additional campus
      development projects. Donations to this project will help provide the students
      with the proper means to develop their computer skills, and will go directly
      towards the purchase of the computers, photocopy machine, and printer of the
      new computer lab.</p>

    description: "<p>The smallest country in Africa, The Gambia, is a young developing
      nation with a high percentage of its population under the age of 14. Currently,
      the official rate of HIV/AIDS remains relatively low in comparison to other
      sub-Saharan countries. However, The Gambia possesses several high risk factors
      which make the nation vulnerable to increased rates of infection; these include
      an active transnational shipping route, active sex trade, little or no sex education
      in the classroom along with high levels of illiteracy, access to media in general,
      and polygamy. In order to combat these risk factors and rising rates of infection,
      Peace Corps partnered with National Aids Secretariat (NAS) and a Gambian association
      in 2010 for the first HIV Bike Trek. Due to success and impact of HIV Bike Trek
      2010, Peace Corps Volunteers organized subsequent HIV Bike Treks in 2011, 2012,
      and 2013, and is now organizing a trek for 2014.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>The ultimate
      goals of HIV Bike Trek are: to educate and empower 808 Gambian youths with the
      knowledge and confidence to protect themselves and their loved ones from HIV.
      The Trek entails PCVs and Gambian counterparts biking across West Coast Region
      and Lower River Region, to four Upper Basic Schools to teach Grade 8 or 9 students
      about HIV/AIDS. Through a two-day intensive training, the students will learn
      about the epidemiology of HIV/AIDS and the life skills to promote speaking out
      and combating stigma and discrimination. By educating Gambian youths about HIV/AIDS
      before they become sexual active, this project hopes to reduce new infections
      rates and prevent HIV/AIDS from becoming a national epidemic.</p>"

      topics such as good study skills, how to write an essay and how to apply to
      college. We also live in a community where very little reading is done outside
      of class, so we would like to encourage reading for fun.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>My

    description: <p>In April 2014, a primary school in Jamaica partnered with a non-profit
      organization to build a multi-purpose court. Previously, the community and primary
      school relied on a a small green field and a hard court at the high school for
      sports and recreation. Now with the new multi-purpose court, another more functional
      area is available for more of the community's residents and youth to participate
      in recreational activities. However, in constructing the court, retaining walls
      were built from the ground on three sides, to create a level plane, but also
      created an unsafe precipice. The community has not been able to completely maximize
      the use of the court, for fear of safety for the children, and the possibility
      of balls/equipment falling over. This project proposal will fund the erection
      of a perimeter fence around the multi-purpose court to keep the participants
      and equipment within the court boundaries. The community's aim is to create
      a safe recreational area for students and community members to develop healthy
      lifestyle choices through sports. A fence will allow for increased access to
      the court, resulting in positive community relationships and sportsmanship through
      recreational activity. The beneficiaries are the school students, community
      sports teams (netball, basketball) and the community members who are interested
      in recreational play. The community will be fundraising to assist in the costs
      of the fence, and will also be stakeholders in using and maintaining the fence
      and court area.</p>

    description: <p>My villiage is the second most visited park in Madagascar. There
      is a great opportunity for income generating activities with the number of tourists
      and guides visiting the area. Bread is available in the village, but it is low-quality
      and is only delivered every few weeks. The plan would be to work with local
      people to develop a small-scale business. They would be trained in basic business
      skills like pricing, marketing, and branding as well as accounting. The initial
      product would be a baguette. However, the location of the oven will be in close
      proximity to a few hotels and could be rented out for events to make pizza.
      Currently, there is only one hotel in town that makes pizza and the times offered
      and selection is limited. This business would allow for custom orders, but the
      primary focus would be baking bread. A trained baker/chef would come and do
      a 1-2 day training on french style. The community would provide some of the
      building materials as well as meals and lodging for the various trainers.</p>
