    description: Contributions to the Malawi Country Fund will support many varied
      Volunteer projects in Malawi. Malawi is one of the poorest countries in the
      world. Malawi is one of the poorest countries in the world. Apart from poverty,
      Malawi is also heavily hit by HIV/AIDS. Typical projects include water and sanitation,
      agricultural development, Income Generation Activities, youth and HIV/AIDS related
      programs. Many such projects fail to materialise or be implemented better due
      to lack of resources or the time/effort it takes to get them. You can make a
      big difference for both the work of the volunteers and people of Malawi by contributions
      to the Malawi Country Fund, which is designed for faster response to the Volunteers
      and their communities. An example of country fund use was funding a local mini-camp
      for a Volunteer's community, using resources and people that were trained at
      one of the national camps, like Camp GLOW or Camp Sky. These can happen frequently
      as $300 - $800 is above easy Volunteer fund raising, but it goes a long way
      in developing motivation/skills of a local group of 30 young women or youth.

      poor infrastructure, access to clean water especially in rural areas, and adverse
      poverty continues to be Kenya's major challenges. Changes in weather patterns
      and high farming costs have compromised farmers' ability to plant and grow adequate
      food, resulting in shortages of food and hunger in some parts of Kenya. The
      demand for food continues to increase household poverty levels with more than
      half of Kenyans (56%) living below the poverty level.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>HIV/AIDS
      is another major social, economic and health problem in Kenya. Many young and
      productive Kenyans die daily as a result of AIDS. Much productive time and resources
      are spent in care and treatment for AIDS patients. The situation is worsened
      when the patient is the household breadwinner.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>In addressing
      these prevalent Kenya community needs, Peace Corps volunteers work hand in hand
      with their Kenyan community counterparts in engaging the community to identify
      their priority needs and possible interventions. The community also identifies
      local resources and gaps within which external assistance is required.</p>"
