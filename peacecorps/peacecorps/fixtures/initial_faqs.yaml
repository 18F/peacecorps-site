      Partnership Program connects Volunteers and their communities with the
      private sector in the U.S. and around the world in order to fund small,
      sustainable, grass roots projects.\n\n
      Volunteers are invited to submit proposals to the Partnership Program to
      obtain financial assistance in support of community projects. In order
      to receive project funding through the Partnership Program, the
      community must make a 25 percent contribution to the total project cost
      and outline success indicators for the individual projects.  The Peace
      Corps then posts the project online to raise funds for the project.\n\n
      The Partnership Program is a proven mechanism for supporting small
      community-based grants.  Over the past ten years, the Partnership
      Program has funded 6,071 Volunteer projects in nearly every sector,
      totaling more than $18 million dollars in grant funds. Last year alone,
      the Partnership Program funded 776 projects in 59 countries, touching
      the lives of 1.4 million people across the globe."}}]}'
