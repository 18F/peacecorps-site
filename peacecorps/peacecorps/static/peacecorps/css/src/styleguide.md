# Peace Corps Styleguide

## Overview

This is an automatically generated style guide for the Peace Corps site. This
styleguide system parses comments in the sites sass files and generates this
markup to be displayed as a guide. The guide is generated with the tool
node-kss.

When new css styling is added to the site, it should be documented according
to the KSS standards. If everything is documented correctly, it will appear in
this style guide when the build is run.

This guide can be used as a reference to use the CSS system as well as a testing
environment for visuals of the site.
